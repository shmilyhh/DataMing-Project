        "abstract": "In this paper we study how to prioritize relevance assessments in the process of creating an Information Retrieval test collection. A test collection consists of a set of queries, a document collection, and a set of relevance assessments. For each query, only a sample of documents from the collection can be manually assessed for relevance. Multiple retrieval strategies are typically used to obtain such sample of documents. And rank fusion plays a fundamental role in creating the sample by combining multiple search results. We propose effective rank fusion models that are adapted to the characteristics of this evaluation task. Our models are based on the distribution of retrieval scores supplied by the search systems and our experiments show that this formal approach leads to natural and competitive solutions when compared to state of the art methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of including pseudo-relevance evidence into the estimation of the score distribution models."

        "abstract": "An ever increasing part of communication between persons involve the use of pictures, due to the cheap availability of powerful cameras on smartphones, and the cheap availability of storage space. The rising popularity of social networking applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and of instant messaging applications, such as WhatsApp, WeChat, is the clear evidence of this phenomenon, due to the opportunity of sharing in real-time a pictorial representation of the context each individual is living in. The media rapidly exploited this phenomenon, using the same channel, either to publish their reports, or to gather additional information on an event through the community of users. While the real-time use of images is managed through metadata associated with the image (i.e., the timestamp, the geolocation, tags, etc.), their retrieval from an archive might be far from trivial, as an image bears a rich semantic content that goes beyond the description provided by its metadata. It turns out that after more than 20 years of research on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), the giant increase in the number and variety of images available in digital format is challenging the research community. It is quite easy to see that any approach aiming at facing such challenges must rely on different image representations that need to be conveniently fused in order to adapt to the subjectivity of image semantics. This paper offers a journey through the main information fusion ingredients that a recipe for the design of a CBIR system should include to meet the demanding needs of users."

This paper presents a new approach for enterprise IS&amp;R systems using fuzzy logic to develop task, user and document profiles to model user information seeking behaviour. Relevance feedback was captured from real users engaged in IS&amp;R tasks. The feedback was used to develop a linear regression model for predicting document relevancy based on implicit relevance indicators. Fuzzy relevance profiles were created using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis for the successful user queries. Fuzzy rule based summarisation was used to integrate the three profiles into a unified index reflecting the semantic weight of the query terms related to the task, user and document. The unified index was used to select the most relevant documents and experts related to the query topic. The overall performance of the system was evaluated based on standard precision and recall metrics which show significant improvements in retrieving relevant documents in response to user queries."

        "abstract": "Evaluating Information Retrieval systems is crucial to making progress in search technologies. Evaluation is often based on assembling reference collections consisting of documents, queries and relevance judgments done by humans. In large-scale environments, exhaustively judging relevance becomes infeasible. Instead, only a pool of documents is judged for relevance. By selectively choosing documents from the pool we can optimize the number of judgments required to identify a given number of relevant documents. We argue that this iterative selection process can be naturally modeled as a reinforcement learning problem and propose innovative and formal adjudication methods based on multi-armed bandits. Casting document judging as a multi-armed bandit problem is not only theoretically appealing, but also leads to highly effective adjudication methods. Under this bandit allocation framework, we consider stationary and non-stationary models and propose seven new document adjudication methods (five stationary methods and two non-stationary variants). Our paper also reports a series of experiments performed to thoroughly compare our new methods against current adjudication methods. This comparative study includes existing methods designed for pooling-based evaluation and existing methods designed for metasearch. Our experiments show that our theoretically grounded adjudication methods can substantially minimize the assessment effort."

        "abstract": "Multimodal Retrieval is a well-established approach for image retrieval. Usually, images are accompanied by text caption along with associated documents describing the image. Textual query expansion as a form of enhancing image retrieval is a relatively less explored area. In this paper, we first study the effect of expanding textual query on both image and its associated text retrieval. Our study reveals that judicious expansion of textual query through keyphrase extraction can lead to better results, either in terms of text-retrieval or both image and text-retrieval. To establish this, we use two well-known keyphrase extraction techniques based on tf-idf and KEA. While query expansion results in increased retrieval efficiency, it is imperative that the expansion be semantically justified. So, we propose a graph-based keyphrase extraction model that captures the relatedness between words in terms of both mutual information and relevance feedback. Most of the existing works have stressed on bridging the semantic gap by using textual and visual features, either in combination or individually. The way these text and image features are combined determines the efficacy of any retrieval. For this purpose, we adopt Fisher-LDA to adjudge the appropriate weights for each modality. This provides us with an intelligent decision-making process favoring the feature set to be infused into the final query. Our proposed algorithm is shown to supersede the previously mentioned keyphrase extraction algorithms for query expansion significantly. A rigorous set of experiments performed on ImageCLEF-2011 Wikipedia Retrieval task dataset validates our claim that capturing the semantic relation between words through Mutual Information followed by expansion of a textual query using relevance feedback can simultaneously enhance both text and image retrieval."

Studies have shown that human could segregate target from its surrounding environment, which is intimately associated with the brain memory mechanism. However, it is not quite clear about how the visual images are stored and retrieved in the human brain. In this paper, we propose a psychologically visual information storage and retrieval model (PVISRM) based on sparse coding and probabilistic decision theory. First, the dense scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm is applied to extract the features of visual images and then the extracted features are represented by sparse coding. In the storage procedure, each component of the feature vector is correctly copied with certain probability generated by an exponential distribution. For retrieval, the likelihood ratio between the probe image feature vector and that of each studied image is calculated based on probabilistic theory. Then the category likelihood ratio between the probe image and each category is obtained by adding the ratio values of all images belonging to the same category. Finally, the Bayesian decision rule for image classification is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed PVISRM model can obtain good classification performance and outperforms the SVM approach."

In this work, we present agent-based content retrieval, which provides information-centric DTN support as an application module without modifications to ICN message processing. This enables flexible interoperability in changing environments. If no content source can be found via wireless multi-hop routing, requesters may exploit the mobility of neighbor nodes (called agents) by delegating content retrieval to them. Agents that receive a delegation and move closer to content sources can retrieve data and return it back to requesters. We show that agent-based content retrieval may be even more efficient in scenarios where multi-hop communication is possible. Furthermore, we show that broadcast communication may not be necessarily the best option since dynamic unicast requests have little overhead and can better exploit short contact times between nodes (no broadcast delays required for duplicate suppression)."

Building patient cohorts using electronic health records (EHRs) and searching literature for topics of interest are some IR use cases. Meanwhile, natural language processing (NLP), such as tokenization or Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging, has been developed for processing clinical documents or biomedical literature. We hypothesize that NLP can be incorporated into IR to strengthen the conventional IR models. In this study, we propose two NLP-empowered IR models, POS-BoW and POS-MRF, which incorporate automatic POS-based term weighting schemes into bag-of-word (BoW) and Markov Random Field (MRF) IR models, respectively. In the proposed models, the POS-based term weights are iteratively calculated by utilizing a cyclic coordinate method where golden section line search algorithm is applied along each coordinate to optimize the objective function defined by mean average precision (MAP). In the empirical experiments, we used the data sets from the Medical Records track in Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2011 and 2012 and the Genomics track in TREC 2004. The evaluation on TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records tracks shows that, for the POS-BoW models, the mean improvement rates for IR evaluation metrics, MAP, bpref, and P@10, are 10.88%, 4.54%, and 3.82%, compared to the BoW models; and for the POS-MRF models, these rates are 13.59%, 8.20%, and 8.78%, compared to the MRF models. Additionally, we experimentally verify that the proposed weighting approach is superior to the simple heuristic and frequency based weighting approaches, and validate our POS category selection. Using the optimal weights calculated in this experiment, we tested the proposed models on the TREC 2004 Genomics track and obtained average of 8.63% and 10.04% improvement rates for POS-BoW and POS-MRF, respectively. These significant improvements verify the effectiveness of leveraging POS tagging for biomedical IR tasks."

Most of the prior work employ language dependent resources or training texts in studying the nature of errors. However, not much research has been reported that focuses on improving retrieval performance from erroneous text in the absence of training data. We propose a novel approach for detecting OCR errors and improving retrieval performance from the erroneous corpus in a situation where training samples are not available to model errors. In this paper we propose a method that automatically identifies erroneous term variants in the noisy corpus, which are used for query expansion, in the absence of clean text. We employ an effective combination of contextual information and string matching techniques. Our proposed approach automatically identifies the erroneous variants of query terms and consequently leads to improvement in retrieval performance through query expansion. Our proposed approach does not use any training data or any language specific resources like thesaurus for identification of error variants. It also does not expend any knowledge about the language except that the word delimiter is blank space. We have tested our approach on erroneous Bangla (Bengali in English) and Hindi FIRE collections, and also on TREC Legal IIT CDIP and TREC 5 Confusion track English corpora.

Bi/multilingual students were recruited from a Canadian university and a community college both located in London, Ontario. A total of 250 (N = 250) students completed a web survey through a link that was embedded in an invitation e-mail. Results showed that though advancements in NLP technology have alleviated some of the linguistic related challenges that some bi/multilingual academic users face while searching for information online, language barriers do still exist for some especially at the query formulation stage. The study found that an increase in Multilingual Information Access (MLIA) tools on electronic databases coupled with appropriate information literacy instruction could be helpful in further alleviating language barriers."

The LBP-based operator extracts the textural information of an image by considering the neighboring pixel values. A single or join histogram can be derived from the LBP code which can be used as an image feature descriptor in some applications. However, the LBP-based feature is not a good candidate in capturing the color information of an image, making it is less suitable for measuring the similarity of color images with rich color information. This work overcomes this problem by adding an additional color feature, namely Color Information Feature (CIF), along with the LBP-based feature in the image retrieval and classification systems. The CIF and LBP-based feature adequately represent the color and texture features. As documented in the experimental result, the hybrid CIF and LBP-based feature presents a promising result and outperforms the existing methods over several image databases. Thus, it can be a very competitive candidate in retrieval and classification application."

This cluster-based CBIR system utilizes an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group images into visually separable clusters within the dataset. The proposed clustering does not utilize any background data either related to the semantics of images or the number of clusters formed. At each intermediate step, a representative image is chosen to denote a cluster. This image represents all images in a cluster and hence, there is some loss of information, which is tracked and combined with proportional reduction in error method to automatically get the number of clusters. Experimental results obtained show the efficiency of the clustering algorithm. Image retrieval results are also presented to show efficacy of the developed system in retrieving semantically more similar images."

The present work makes a first attempt to fill this gap by extending our previous work on monolingual retrieval in order to study the impact that the progressive addition of misspellings to input queries has, this time, on the output of CLIR systems. Two approaches for dealing with this problem are analyzed in this paper. Firstly, the use of automatic spelling correction techniques for which, in turn, we consider two algorithms: the first one for the correction of isolated words and the second one for a correction based on the linguistic context of the misspelled word. The second approach to be studied is the use of character n-grams both as index terms and translation units, seeking to take advantage of their inherent robustness and language-independence. All these approaches have been tested on a from-Spanish-to-English CLIR system, that is, Spanish queries on English documents. Real, user-generated spelling errors have been used under a methodology that allows us to study the effectiveness of the different approaches to be tested and their behavior when confronted with different error rates. The results obtained show the great sensitiveness of classic word-based approaches to misspelled queries, although spelling correction techniques can mitigate such negative effects. On the other hand, the use of character n-grams provides great robustness against misspellings."

        "abstract": "Long-term memories can undergo destabilization/restabilization processes, collectively called reconsolidation. However, the parameters that trigger memory reconsolidation are poorly understood and are a matter of intense investigation. Particularly, memory retrieval is widely held as requisite to initiate reconsolidation. This assumption makes sense since only relevant cues will induce reconsolidation of a specific memory. However, recent studies show that pharmacological inhibition of retrieval does not avoid memory from undergoing reconsolidation, indicating that memory reconsolidation occurs through a process that can be dissociated from retrieval. We propose that retrieval is not a unitary process but has two dissociable components; one leading to the expression of memory and the other to reconsolidation, referred herein as executer and integrator respectively. The executer would lead to the behavioral expression of the memory. This component would be the one disrupted on the studies that show reconsolidation independence from retrieval. The integrator would deal with reconsolidation. This component of retrieval would lead to long-term memory destabilization when specific conditions are met. We think that an important number of reports are consistent with the hypothesis that reconsolidation is only initiated when updating information is acquired. We suggest that the integrator would initiate reconsolidation to integrate updating information into long-term memory."

The AKR technique is based on a novel coverage value that has its calculation centered on author-specified keywords. We performed an offline evaluation experiment with four variants of the AKR technique along with three state-of-the-art approaches involving collaborative filtering and graph ranking algorithms. Findings show that the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) enhanced variant of the AKR technique performs better than other techniques, satisfying most requirements for a reading list. A user evaluation study was conducted with 132 researchers to gauge user interest on the proposed technique using 14 evaluation measures. Results show that (i) students group are more satisfied with the recommended papers than staff group, (ii) popularity measure is strongly correlated with the output quality measures and (iii) the measures familiarity, usefulness and \u2018agreeability on a good list\u2019 were found to be strong predictors for user satisfaction.

Thus, the inappropriate handling of diacritics reduces the retrieval performance in search engines. A straightforward solution to this problem is to normalize tokens by replacing diacritic characters with their American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) counterparts. However, this so-called ASCIIfication produces either synthetic words that are not legitimate Turkish words or legitimate words with meanings that are completely different from those of the original words. These non-valid synthetic words cannot be processed by morphological analysis components (such as stemmers or lemmatizers), which expect the input to be valid Turkish words. By contrast, synthetic words are not a problem when no stemmer or a simple first-n-characters-stemmer is used in the text analysis pipeline. This difference emphasizes the notion of the diacritic sensitivity of stemmers. In this study, we propose and evaluate an alternative solution based on the application of deASCIIfication, which restores accented letters in query terms or text documents. Our risk-sensitive evaluation results showed that the diacritics restoration approach yielded more effective and robust results compared with normalizing tokens to remove diacritics."

        "abstract": "A main challenge in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is to estimate a proper translation model from available translation resources, since translation quality directly affects the retrieval performance. Among different translation resources, we focus on obtaining translation models from comparable corpora, because they provide appropriate translations for both languages and domains with limited linguistic resources. In this paper, we employ a two-step approach to build an effective translation model from comparable corpora, without requiring any additional linguistic resources, for the CLIR task. In the first step, translations are extracted by deriving correlations between source\u2013target word pairs. These correlations are used to estimate word translation probabilities in the second step. We propose a language modeling approach for the first step, where modeling based on probability distribution provides two key advantages. First, our approach can be tuned easier in comparison with heuristically adjusted previous work. Second, it provides a principled basis for integrating additional lexical and translational relations to improve the accuracy of translations from comparable corpora. As an indication, we integrate monolingual relations of word co-occurrences into the process of translation extraction, which helps to extract more reliable translations for low-frequency words in a comparable corpus. Experimental results on an English\u2013Persian comparable corpus show that our method outperforms the previous approaches in terms of both translation quality and the performance of CLIR. Indeed, the proposed method is naturally applicable to any comparable corpus, regardless of its languages. In addition, we demonstrate the significant impact of word translation probabilities, estimated in the second step of our approach, on the performance of CLIR."

In this paper we examine candidate retrieval, where the goal is to find potential source documents of a suspicious text. Our proposed method for cross-language plagiarism detection is a keyword-focused approach. Since plagiarism usually happens in parts of the text, there is a requirement to segment the texts into fragments to detect local similarity. Therefore we propose a topic-based segmentation algorithm to convert the suspicious document to a set of related passages. After that, we use a proximity-based model to retrieve documents with the best matching passages. Experiments show promising results for this important phase of cross-language plagiarism detection."

High effort in the input message validation process causes a denial of service weakness of backbone services. Moreover, request messages contain removable data sets making them unnecessarily long, which leads to high bandwidth requirements for reliable communication between backbone and mobile node. Thus, we propose a new data retrieval scheme increasing robustness of the backbone to denial of service attacks and decreasing length of nodes' request messages.

In content centric networks emphasis is on data rather than its location. Content centric networks, support data caching in intermediate nodes that allows them to serve future request. This results in more efficient content delivery. As data is cached at various intermediate nodes, the owner of the data has no control over the data. Data stored in intermediate nodes can be vulnerable and be exploited by the intermediate nodes, malicious users and intruders, who do not have legitimate access to these data. In addition to this entire data is being broadcasted by the intermediate nodes whenever they receive a request for that corresponding data. This utilizes a substantial portion of the network bandwidth. To address these issues we propose a framework in this paper that (1) efficiently organizes data that is cached in intermediate nodes using a NOSQL (Not Only SQL) graph database, (2) reduces the network utilization, (3) secures all the data transferred across content centric networks, such that only owners of the data can provide access to the consumers of their data and (4) provides role-based access to the consumers, and reduces complications in key distribution and management. Our experimental results indicate that our framework is able to reduce network utilization by over 79% in the best-case scenario and by over 65% in the worst-case scenario."

In this paper, a novelty approach based on three matching-query layers driven by ontologies on the heterogeneous data sources is presented. A technique of query contextualization is proposed for addressing to available heterogeneous data sources including social networks. It consists of contextualizing a query in which whether a data source does not contain a relevant result, other sources either provide an answer or in the best case, each one adds a relevant answer to the set of results. This approach is a collaborative learning system based on experience level of users in different domains. The retrieval process is achieved from three domains: temporal, geographical and social, which are involved in the user-content context. The work is oriented towards defining a GIScience collaborative learning for geographic information retrieval, using social networks, web and geodatabases."

Self-relevant information is likely to be accompanied by certain affective and motivational states. For instance, individuals may be afraid to be seriously ill and, thus, feel threatened. Threat is known to elicit preferential processing of positive information. Therefore, we predicted that under threat more positive search terms are retrieved from memory and more positive information is retrieved from already encoded online information than in a control condition. Two experiments supported this prediction. Thus, information processing during Internet search is positively biased under threat. This positive bias can satisfy coping needs, but can at the same time have a negative impact on subsequent behavior and decisions."

While the Bag of Features (BoF) representation is commonly used for image retrieval, it lacks spatial information. In this paper, we present two novel image representation methods based on the histograms of triangles, which add spatial information to the inverted index of BoF representation. Histograms of triangles are computed at two levels, by dividing an image into two and four triangles that are evaluated separately. Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed image representations enhance the performance of image retrieval."

Behavioral studies have demonstrated that incidental learning of new \u201cfoil\u201d words in a recognition test is superior if the participant is trying to remember studied items that were semantically encoded compared to items that were non-semantically encoded. Here, we applied subsequent memory analysis to fMRI data to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the \u201cfoil effect\u201d. Participants encoded information during deep semantic and shallow non-semantic tasks and were tested in a subsequent blocked memory task to examine how orienting retrieval towards different types of information influences the incidental encoding of new words presented as foils during the memory test phase. To assess memory for foils, participants performed a further surprise old/new recognition test involving foil words that were encountered during the previous memory test blocks as well as completely new words. Subsequent memory effects, distinguishing successful versus unsuccessful incidental encoding of foils, were observed in regions that included the left inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex. The left inferior frontal gyrus exhibited disproportionately larger subsequent memory effects for semantic than non-semantic foils, and significant overlap in activity during semantic, but not non-semantic, initial encoding and foil encoding. The results suggest that orienting retrieval towards different types of foils involves re-implementing the neurocognitive processes that were involved during initial encoding."

Supervised hashing methods, which utilize the labeled information to promote the quality of hashing functions, achieve promising performance. However, the existing supervised methods generally focus on utilizing coarse semantic information between samples (e.g. similar or dissimilar), and ignore fine semantic information between samples which may degrade the quality of hashing functions. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a supervised hashing method for cross-media retrieval which utilizes the coarse-to-fine semantic similarity to learn a sharing space. The inter-category and intra-category semantic similarity are effectively preserved in the sharing space. Then an iterative descent scheme is proposed to achieve an optimal relaxed solution, and hashing codes can be generated by quantizing the relaxed solution. At last, to further improve the discrimination of hashing codes, an orthogonal rotation matrix is learned by minimizing the quantization loss while preserving the optimality of the relaxed solution. Extensive experiments on widely used Wiki and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods."

In the second method, the latent Dirichlet allocation model is expanded to deal with relevant query terms. The topic of each term within a given document may be sampled using either the normal document-specific mixture weights in LDA using query-specific mixture weights.

        "abstract": "Information Centric Networking (ICN) leverages in-network caching to provide efficient data distribution and better performance by replicating contents in multiple nodes to bring content nearer the users. Since contents are stored and replicated into node caches, the content validity must be assured end-to-end. Each content object carries a digital signature to provide a proof of its integrity, authenticity, and provenance. However, the use of digital signatures requires a key management infrastructure to manage the key life cycle. To perform a proper signature verification, a node needs to know whether the signing key is valid or it has been revoked. This paper discusses how to retrieve up-to-date signing keys in the ICN scenario. In the usual public key infrastructure, the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enable applications to obtain the revocation status of a certificate. However, the push-based distribution of Certificate Revocation Lists and the request/response paradigm of Online Certificate Status Protocol should be fit in the mechanism of named-data. We consider three possible approaches to distribute up-to-date keys in a similar way to the current CRL and OCSP. Then, we suggest a fourth protocol leveraging a set of distributed notaries, which naturally fits the ICN scenario. Finally, we evaluate the number and size of exchanged messages of each solution, and then we compare the methods considering the perceived latency by the end nodes and the throughput on the network links."

However, problems such as why data fusion can increase effectiveness and favorable conditions for the use of data fusion methods are poorly resolved at best. In this paper, we formally describe data fusion under a geometric framework, in which each component result returned from an information retrieval system for a given query is represented as a point in a multi-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance is the measure by which the effectiveness and similarity of search results are judged. This allows us to explain all component results and fused results using geometrical principles. In such a framework, score-based data fusion becomes a deterministic problem. Several interesting features of the centroid-based data fusion method and the linear combination method are discussed. Nevertheless, in retrieval evaluation, ranking-based measures are the most popular. Therefore, this paper investigates the relation and correlation between the Euclidean distance and several typical ranking-based measures. We indeed find that a very strong correlation exists between these. It means that the theorems and observations obtained using the Euclidean distance remain valid when ranking-based measures are used. The proposed framework enables us to have a better understanding of score-based data fusion and use score-based data fusion methods more precisely and effectively in various ways."

The NN retrieval is able to capture the observed soil moisture temporal variations with a station-average correlation and anomaly correlation of 0.45 and 0.35, respectively. For most ground stations the model obtained a higher temporal correlation skill, with average correlation and anomaly correlation values of 0.53 and 0.46, respectively. For stations in data-sparse regions, the NN retrieval showed a slightly better performance than the model, illustrating the potential of soil moisture retrievals to inform models in data-sparse areas. A time series analysis further showed that the retrieval is well able to capture soil moisture variability outside of active precipitation phases, such as the soil moisture behavior during the dry down phase. Compared to the ESA-CCI retrieval, the NN methodology obtained higher correlations, as a result of its ability to use the complementary information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors. A global evaluation of the retrieval errors through a triple collocation analysis with SMOS and GLDAS soil moisture estimates showed that the errors are high in energy limited regions, where the NN retrieval appears to be lacking input information. In the data-sparse regions of Africa and South America, the triple collocation analysis confirmed the higher skill of the NN retrieval compared to the model."

When applying this effect in education, it is an important question which type of retrieval task works best. Several studies have shown that learning is enhanced by linking new information with prior knowledge. A potential approach to making retrieval more effective, therefore, is to enrich retrieval instructions with the requirement to elaborate on the learning contents and link them to what is already known. In this study, we compared a free recall condition, as used in many studies on learning by retrieval, with a prompted recall condition in which learners were required to recall the information and apply it to their lives. Fifty-six undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of these two conditions. They learned from a video-recorded lecture. One week later, learning outcomes were assessed by a posttest measuring fact recall and comprehension of the contents from the video lecture. Learners in the prompted recall group, compared to the free recall group, used more elaborative strategies in response to the recall task and achieved better comprehension scores. The effect on comprehension was mediated by the use of elaborative strategies. This pattern of results supports the constructive retrieval hypothesis, stating that retrieval is most effective when it involves constructive elaboration of the contents being learned. Our findings also encourage the use of pedagogical tasks in classroom teaching that combine elaboration and retrieval."

        "abstract": "Three experiments examined the impact of matching retrieval modality at retrieval practice and at test on retrieval-induced forgetting. Participants learned sequential finger movements to be performed either with the left or with the right index finger. Subsequently, they selectively practiced half the items of one hand. A final recall test then assessed memory for all initially learned items. We contrasted different retrieval modalities. In Experiment 1, retrieval practice pertained to motor responses in one experimental condition but it pertained to visual sequence displays in another condition. The final recall test was motoric in both conditions. In Experiment 2, retrieval practice always pertained to visual sequence displays but the final recall test either pertained to motor responses or to visual sequence displays. Retrieval-induced forgetting emerged only when the modality of the final recall test matched the modality of retrieval practice. In Experiment 3, retrieval practice either involved executing motor sequences with the same finger as in the learning phase or participants had to use the opposite hand for indicating sequences. An effector change for retrieval practice eliminated retrieval-induced forgetting in a test requiring the execution of motor sequences again with the same finger as in the learning phase. We suggest that retrieval-induced forgetting occurred as a consequence of retrieval-modality-specific inhibition."

The proposed method uses several sophisticated fuzzy-rough feature selection methods and combines the results of these methods to obtain a prominent feature subset for image representation for a particular query. Next, fuzzy-rough upper approximation of the target set (relevant list of images) with respect to the entire database that is represented by the prominent feature subset, is computed for retrieval and ranking. The information table on which every feature selection method works is small in size. Main reasons of performance boost of the proposed method are twofold. One is efficient feature subsets selection. The other reason is the fuzzy-indiscernibility relation based fuzzy-rough framework for computing upper-approximation which supports the approximate equality or similarity sense of CBIR. Fuzzy-rough upper approximation possibly adds more similar images in the relevant list from boundary region to expand the relevant list. The effectiveness of the proposed method is supported by the comparative results obtained from several single dimensionality reduction method, several clustering based retrieval techniques and also tested for face image retrieval."

In this paper we propose a new unsupervised method that uses word sense discrimination in IR. The method we develop is based on spectral clustering and reorders an initially retrieved document list by boosting documents that are semantically similar to the target query. For several TREC ad hoc collections we show that our method is useful in the case of queries which contain ambiguous terms. We are interested in improving the level of precision after 5, 10 and 30 retrieved documents (P@5, P@10, P@30) respectively.

To construct a well-suited electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding module for BHCR, we conducted a comparative inspection on the selection of classification algorithms, and adopted linear discriminant analysis and random forests as a feature extraction method and classification algorithm, respectively. We also introduced a CV system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) as a component of BHCR. A Bayesian brain-computer interaction (BBCI) module was carefully designed so that for each presented image, a Bayesian model that takes HV insight as prior information and CV insights as sample information is built up to present retrieval results. Unlike existing HV-CV coupled works that usually require extra manual labor, BHCR directly enhanced retrieval performance with the help of CV insights. As an auxiliary work and a natural extension of BHCR, we then proposed a probability propagation scheme that incorporates EEG decoding insights to improve the CV system and a one-shot image database retrieval scheme. We demonstrated the effectiveness of BHCR by extensive experiments and simulations on both the entire framework and its sub-components. The results showed the following: (1) The performance of BHCR was significantly better than the EEG-only mechanism in both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and classification aspects; (2) The robustness of BHCR was ensured by its process flow and the steady performances of its sub-components."

To deal with uncertain information, the mechanism supported by the regular ontology may not be adequate and the requirement for new technique arises. Fuzzy based methods are the proven methods to interpret the uncertain information. The combination of Fuzzy and Ontology based information retrieval provides better results as they mainly deal with the semantics and the uncertainty of information. Keyword matching is one another widely used method which matches the input keywords with the existing information domain to find the best match results. When the input queries are complex the fuzzy ontology based information retrieval which respects the user's keyword and the domain produces more accurate results. This work enlarges the fuzzy ontology knowledge results along with the input queries and keyword matching. The given algorithm is a hybrid technique based on matching extracted instances from the input queries and in information domain.

To address these two problems, we propose a new method for image retrieval based on feature fusion and sparse representation over separable vocabulary. Firstly, a large vocabulary is generated on the training dataset. Secondly, the vocabulary is separated into a number of vocabularies with medium sizes. Thirdly, for a given query image, we adopt sparse representation to select a vocabulary for retrieval. In the proposed method, the large vocabulary can guarantee a relatively high accuracy, while the vocabularies with medium sizes are responsible for high recall. Also, in order to reduce quantization error and improve recall, sparse representation scheme is used for visual words quantization. Moreover, both the local features and the global features are fused to improve the recall. Our proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Coil20 and Holidays. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves good performance."

A theoretical sensitivity study proves the proposed method is insensitive to the distortion of initial BRDF. The presented algorithm is tested on AATSR data around four different Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites representing various types of land surface. Compared with the four selected AERONET sites' AOD and BRDF-derived albedo from AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN) data in corresponding four AERONET sites, the presented algorithm proves considerable accuracy for various type of land surface with correlation of AOD ranging from 0.647 to 0.911 and correlation of BRDF-derived albedo ranging from 0.483 to 0.944.

        "abstract": "Cross-media retrieval is to submit data of any media type, and get semantically relevant results of different media types. Most existing approaches project low-level features of cross-media data onto a unified feature space. However, some of these feature spaces usually have no explicit semantics, which ignore the intrinsic semantic information contained in the original media content. The others only have coarse-grained semantics suffering from the ambiguity of high-level concepts, because the coarse-grained correlation between low-level features and high-level concepts is simply utilized. Hence, the aforementioned approaches cannot generate the descriptive representation of media content, leading to reduced effectiveness to measure the semantic similarities among cross-media data. To address the above problems, we propose a novel approach to cross-media retrieval by exploiting the fine-grained correlation at the entity level and generating the unified descriptive representation. Concretely, the proposed approach first constructs an entity level with fine-grained semantics between low-level features and high-level concepts. Second, by minimizing (maximizing) the distances between media content with positive (negative) correlation at the entity level, we learn the distance-preserving entity projections (DPEP) and generate the unified descriptive representation of media content. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

However, to improve image retrieval accuracy, considering only the most salient object in an image is insufficient because the background also influences the accuracy of image retrieval. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel concept called the extended salient region (ESR). First, the salient region of an input image is detected using a Region Contrast (RC) algorithm. Then, a polar coordinate system is constructed; the centroid of the salient region is set as the pole. Next, the regions surrounding the salient region are determined by the neighboring regions, moving in a counterclockwise direction. The resulting combination of the salient region and its surrounding regions is defined as the ESR. We extract the visual content from the ESR using the well-known Bag of Words (BoW) model based on Gabor, SIFT and HSVH features and propose a graph model of the visual content nodes to represent the input image. Then, we design a novel algorithm to perform matching between two images. We also define a new similarity measure by combining the similarities of the salient region and the surrounding regions using weights. Finally, to better evaluate the image retrieval accuracy, an improved measure called the mean label average precision (MLAP) is proposed. The results of experiments on three benchmark datasets (Corel, TU Darmstadt, and Caltech 101) demonstrate that our proposed ESR model and region-matching algorithm are highly effective at image retrieval, and can achieve more accurate query results than current state-of-the-art methods."

Previous studies have investigated predictors of successful lexical retrieval after anomia, and access to syntax during lexical retrieval. The aim of the current study is to examine impaired lexical retrieval in Arabic at two levels: predictors of lexical retrieval, and access to syntax during lexical retrieval, via checking whether syntactic cueing (using the definite article/\u0259l-/'the' prior to nouns) facilitates noun retrieval in Arabic aphasia, with regard to naming speed and accuracy, and establishing the determinants of aphasic noun retrieval in Arabic. Three participants with anomia following CVA named 186 pictures from a published Arabic database in two conditions: bare noun condition, and determiner + noun condition. Participants' accuracy and reaction times were compared in both conditions. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis was carried out to test the effect of psycholinguistic variables (visual complexity, name agreement, age of acquisition, imageability and other intrinsic variables) on successful lexical retrieval to determine predictors of Arabic noun retrieval after anomia. The production of the determiner + noun in picture naming facilitated spoken naming in all three participants. Nouns produced with the determiner were produced faster and more accurately than their counterparts produced without the determiner. The two participants with agrammatism produced morpho-syntactic errors in the bare noun condition, but not in the determiner + noun condition, suggesting that the determiner sets up a noun phrase frame with a slot for the noun to be filled, resulting in responses that are faster and more accurate. Age of acquisition and imageability were the only two variables that had influence across the participants. These results have theoretical and clinical implications for lexical retrieval models."

Meanwhile, the spatial structure in raw images always lost in most previous methods. Encouraged by the recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a novel Spatial Pyramid Deep Hashing (SPDH) algorithm is developed for the task of fast image retrieval. In our SPDH algorithm, the CNN with a spatial pyramid pooling and a locally-connected layer with binary activation functions is utilized to build the end-to-end relation between the raw image data and the binary hashing codes for fast indexing. Different from the fully-connected layer, the locally-connected layer can consider each local spatial bin as an independent unit and only connect the local bin to preserve the spatial pyramid structure for hash codes. The learning of both the hash function and the feature representations are jointly optimized via backward propagation with classification or similarity loss function on the large-scale labeled dataset such as ImageNet. Moreover, a spatial pyramid binary pattern matching algorithm is developed to achieve partial local similar matching among the images. Our experimental results have shown that our SPDH method can outperform several state-of-the-art hashing algorithms on the CIFAR-10, SIVAL and the Oxford buildings datasets."

All prior local patterns are based on gray-level difference of pixels located in a square or circle. Since many of the actual textures can be represented by intensity relationship of pixels along a line, these methods do not have a suitable ability to represent texture information. In prior methods, difference between referenced pixel and its adjacent pixel is encoded with two, three or four values which leads to information loss of the image. The proposed LDRP is based on gray-level difference of pixels along a line and their weighted combinations. In addition, multi-level coding in different directions is used instead of binary coding. The performance of the proposed method is compared with prior methods including local binary pattern (LBP), local ternary pattern (LTP), local derivative pattern (LDP), local tetra pattern (LTrP) and local vector pattern (LVP). The proposed LDRP outperforms all mentioned prior methods by at least 3.82% and 5.17% in terms of average precision on Brodatz and VisTex databases, respectively."

Based on the physiological structure of human eyes and visual perception mechanism, HIDs are designed to explore the internal correlations among different image feature spaces with image structure and multi-scale analysis, not only characterizing the low-level features, such as color, shape and texture, but also imitating the process of visual information transfer and perception in high-level understanding with the help of the proposed visual optimization model for feature fusion. Comparing with other existing methods applied to content-based image retrieval (CBIR) on four datasets, the usefulness and effectiveness of the HIDs are shown. Extensive experimental results can also demonstrate this."

In such deployments it is necessary to continuously monitor the accuracy of each of the sensor data streams so that we can account for sudden failures of sensors, or errors due to calibration drive or biofouling. In multimedia information retrieval (MMIR), we search through archives of multimedia artefacts like video programs, by implementing several independent retrieval systems or agents, and we combine the outputs of each retrieval agent in order to generate an overall ranking. In this paper we draw parallels between these seemingly very different applications and show how they share several similarities. In the case of environmental monitoring we also need some mechanism by which we can establish the trust and reputation of each contributing sensor, though this is something we do not need in MMIR. In this paper we present an outline of a trust and reputation framework we have developed and deployed for monitoring the performance of sensors in a heterogeneous sensor network."

In this study, we propose a data-driven method for outdoor scene modeling by using fast retrieval and automatic optimization layout techniques. Unlike the current methods, we first employ an improved manifold ranking algorithm in the sketch-based 3D model retrieval stage, which achieves higher accuracy. Next, according to the particular properties of outdoor architectures, specialized constraints are then proposed to define an energy function, which meets both the functional and aesthetic requirements. Finally, we cast the auto-arrangement as a combinatorial optimization problem, which we solve using an optimization algorithm. In contrast to the earlier version of this method, which was presented at Cyberworlds 2016, this extended version combines simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization algorithms, which have the advantages of rapid convergence and avoiding becoming trapped by local minima. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more intuitive and effective for modeling 3D scenes, and can be employed in the actual development of game scenes."

Typically, the information is discovered or reported only after the components from the donation have been transfused. Blood centers may notify the transfusion service and provide a statement of the potential risk, if any, associated with the blood components, but the transfusion service must decide if further investigation, notification of the transfusing physician, or counseling of the patient is warranted. Currently, postdonation information (PDI) affects an estimated 1 in 600 donations in the United States. Despite the regularity with which PDI occurs, there has been little analysis of the main sources of PDI, associated transfusion risk, or the actual benefit of various actions taken as a result of PDI. However, blood centers attempt to retrieve thousands of components each year for PDI: actions that can cause confusion, concern, and complaints from hospitals and transfusion services. Postdonation information is largely a reflection of the inherent limitations of the current donor screening process, which is error-prone and uses broad, precautionary questions to guard against theoretical or extremely remote risks. This article reviews the most commonly reported PDI and available information on the possible risk associated with the transfused components from the involved donations, to formulate a framework for blood center retrieval actions and hospital notification that is consistent with current regulations and commensurate with the likelihood of adverse outcomes associated with the most commonly reported PDI."

To handle arbitrarily shaped objects, we propose a scheme which allows incremental matching of segments based on similarity to the query object. Further, we adjust the feature metric based on the quality of the query results to improve results in a second round of querying. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two datasets for both segmentation and retrieval, validating the results using ground truth data. Comparison with other state of the art methods further enforces the validity of the proposed method.

Compared with the text documents, images consume much more storage and thus are very suitable to be stored on the cloud servers. The outsourcing of CBIR to the cloud servers can be a very typical service in cloud computing. For the privacy-preserving purposes, sensitive images, such as medical and personal images, need to be encrypted before being outsourced, which will cause the CBIR technologies in plaintext domain unusable. In this paper, we propose a scheme that supports CBIR over the encrypted images without revealing the sensitive information to the cloud server. Firstly, the feature vectors are extracted to represent the corresponding images. Then, the pre-filter tables are constructed with the locality-sensitive hashing to increase the search efficiency. Next, the feature vectors are protected by the secure k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm. The security analysis and experiments show the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme."

        "abstract": "The web is a network of linked sites whereby each site either forms a physical portal or a standalone page. In the former case, the portal presents an access point to its embedded web pages that coherently present a specific topic. In the latter case, there are millions of standalone web pages, that are scattered throughout the web, having the same topic and could be conceptually linked together to form virtual portals. Search engines have been developed to help users in reaching the adequate pages in an efficient and effective manner. All the known current search engine techniques rely on the web page as the basic atomic search unit. They ignore the conceptual links, that reveal the implicit web related meanings, among the retrieved pages. However, building a semantic model for the whole portal may contain more semantic information than a model of scattered individual pages. In addition, user queries can be poor and contain imprecise terms that do not reflect the real user intention. Consequently, retrieving the standalone individual pages that are directly related to the query may not satisfy the user\u2019s need. In this paper, we propose PREFCA, a Portal Retrieval Engine based on Formal Concept Analysis that relies on the portal as the main search unit. PREFCA consists of three phases: First, the information extraction phase that is concerned with extracting portal\u2019s semantic data. Second, the formal concept analysis phase that utilizes formal concept analysis to discover the conceptual links among portal and attributes. Finally, the information retrieval phase where we propose a portal ranking method to retrieve ranked pairs of portals and embedded pages. Additionally, we apply the network analysis rules to output some portal characteristics. We evaluated PREFCA using two data sets, namely the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2010 and ClueWeb09 (category B) test data, for physical and virtual portals respectively. PREFCA proves higher F-measure accuracy, better Mean Average Precision ranking and comparable network analysis and efficiency results than other search engine approaches, namely Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and BM25 techniques. As well, it gains high Mean Average Precision in comparison with learning to rank techniques. Moreover, PREFCA also gains better reach time than Carrot as a well-known topic-based search engine."

This paper focuses on certain aspects of representativeness in database queries and web search, and proposes an approach to extracting a subset of results from original search results in light of high coverage and low redundancy. In the paper, the notion of \u03bb-represent is introduced, which enables us to describe the \u03bb-represent relationship between the sets of data objects. Then, the \u03bb-representative problem is formulated as an extension of the typical set covering problem, which leads to developing a heuristic approach (namely, LamRep) to coping with the problem effectively and efficiently. Notably, LamRep is incorporated with a \u201cvote\u201d mechanism, enhanced with an algorithmic acceleration strategy. Data experiments on benchmark data and a real-world example show that LamRep outperforms the other approaches."

However, the rapidly evolving techniques create a chance to meet the challenge. This paper proposes a framework to realize a one-stop and location based service (LBS) for geospatial information (GI) retrieval on mobile platforms. The framework originally integrates a number of state-of-the-art techniques with geospatial data resources and let them cooperate together to provide a robust and highly available LBS. Cloud platform is used to deploy the server module. A location enabled load balancing algorithm is presented to balance the cloud instance VMs on behalf of LBS. A system named GeoFairy is implemented. It provides a one-stop service for gathering and delivering twelve kinds of GI on real time locations. Two Apps are built for the major mobile ecosystems: iOS and Android. Many tests, including a stress test, have been made via a number of mobile devices at various locations. The results demonstrate that GeoFairy is capable of one-stop delivering real-time GI to users and significantly reducing costs on information searching and retrieving. This feature is very helpful in many scenarios such as disaster responding and military actions. This research paves a way on both theoretical and practical aspects for researchers and developers to realize operational mobile applications for one stop and location based GI retrieval."

The obtained candidate scoring functions are tested on various standard IR collections and several simple but promising functions are identified. We perform extensive experiments to compare these functions with classical IR models. It is observed that these functions are yielding either better or comparable results. We also compare the performance of functions satisfying IR heuristic constraints and those which do not; the former set of functions clearly outperforms the latter, which shows the validity of IR heuristic constraints to design new IR models."

Even though medical thesauri such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and related tools (e.g., the MeSH Browser) were created to help consumers find medical term definitions, the lack of direct and explicit integration of these help tools into a health retrieval system prevented them from effectively achieving their objectives. To explore this issue, we conducted an empirical study with two systems: One is a simple interface system supporting query-based searching; the other is an augmented system with two new components supporting MeSH term searching and MeSH tree browsing. A total of 45 subjects were recruited to participate in the study. The results indicated that the augmented system is more effective than the simple system in terms of improving user-perceived topic familiarity and question\u2013answer performance, even though we did not find users spend more time on the augmented system. The two new MeSH help components played a critical role in participants\u2019 health information retrieval and were found to allow them to develop new search strategies. The findings of the study enhanced our understanding of consumers\u2019 search behaviors and shed light on the design of future health information retrieval systems."

The calculation of the distance between two segmented objects is formulated as a multi-label optimization problem, taking into account the aforementioned graphs. The proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on several datasets, while it has a clear advantage in the case of articulated objects."

A location adjacency matrix is big, and requires constant updates, thus it cannot be stored at the data holder's end. A possible solution would be to have the adjacency matrix stored on a cloud server, the data holder can then query the required adjacency records.

We consider verbosity a different property of queries from length since a verbose query is not necessarily long, it might be succinct and a short query might be verbose. This paper proposes a methodology to automatically detect verbose queries and conditionally modify queries. The methodology proposed in this paper exploits state-of-the-art classification algorithms, combines concepts from a large linguistic database and uses a topic gisting algorithm we designed for verbose query modification purposes. Our experimental results have been obtained using the TREC Robust track collection, thirty topics classified by difficulty degree, four queries per topic classified by verbosity and length, and human assessment of query verbosity. Our results suggest that the methodology for query modification conditioned to query verbosity detection and topic gisting is significantly effective and that query modification should be refined when topic difficulty and query verbosity are considered since these two properties interact and query verbosity is not straightforwardly related to query length."

However, a notable problem emerged in the current IR systems is that the input queries are usually too short and too ambiguous to express their actual idea which largely affects the performance of IR systems. In this study, a novel query recommendation technology which suggests a list of related queries is proposed to resolve these problems. The query concepts can be firstly extracted from the web-snippets of the search result returned by the input query. A bipartite graph is subsequently built to identify the related queries, and the query similarity can be calculated by such bipartite graph. Moreover, by analyzing the URLs clicked by users, we find that some tokens appeared in URLs are very meaningful, especial for some typical topic-based pages. Therefore, these potential tokens which can provide a brief description from the subject of the URL are also considered. In order to reveal the real semantics between queries, the approach TF-IQF model is further discussed, and three features of a query, i.e. clicked documents, associated query and reversed query, are utilized in our approach in depth. Such a method could hopefully acquire the comprehensive idea of a query. To investigate how these three features could be used effectively for query recommendation in search engine, we adopt the benchmark evaluation criterions in our experiments, and the experimental results show its promising results in comparison with state of the art methods."

Specifically, design teams face considerable challenges in making effective use of increasing amounts of information. In order to support product information retrieval and reuse, one approach is to use case-based reasoning (CBR) in which problems are solved \u201cby using or adapting solutions to old problems.\u201d In CBR, a case includes both a representation of the problem and a solution to that problem. Case-based reasoning uses similarity measures to identify cases which are more relevant to the problem to be solved. However, most non-numeric similarity measures are based on syntactic grounds, which often fail to produce good matches when confronted with the meaning associated to the words they compare. To overcome this limitation, ontologies can be used to produce similarity measures that are based on semantics. This paper presents an ontology-based approach that can determine the similarity between two classes using feature-based similarity measures that replace features with attributes. The proposed approach is evaluated against other existing similarities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study on product\u2013service\u2013system design problems."

Research in the domain of uncertainty in illness, however, has demonstrated that uncertainty is a complex phenomenon that shares a complicated relationship with information. Past research on people living with HIV and individuals who have tested positive for genetic risk for different illnesses has revealed that information and the reduction of uncertainty can, in fact, produce anxiety, and that maintaining uncertainty can be associated with optimism and hope. We review the theory of communication and uncertainty management and offer nine principles based on that theoretical work that can be used to influence IR system design. The principles reflect a view of uncertainty as a multi-faceted and dynamic experience, one subject to ongoing appraisal and management efforts that include interaction with and use of information in a variety of forms."

Date is a useful piece of information which has various applications including date-wise videos/scene searching, indexing or retrieval. This paper presents a date spotting based information retrieval system for natural scene image and video frames where text appears with complex backgrounds. We propose a line based date spotting approach using hidden Markov model (HMM) which is used to detect the date information in a given text. Different date models are searched from a line without segmenting characters or words. Given a text line image in RGB, we apply an efficient gray image conversion to enhance the text information. Wavelet decomposition and gradient sub-bands are used to enhance text information in gray scale. Next, pyramid histogram of oriented gradient (PHOG) feature has been extracted from gray image and binary images for date-spotting framework. Binary and gray image features are combined by MLP based tandem approach. Finally, to boost the performance further, a shape coding based scheme is used to combine the similar shape characters in same class during word spotting. For our experiment, three different date models have been constructed to search similar date information having numeric dates that contains numeral values and punctuations and semi-numeric that contains dates with numerals along with months in scene/video text. We have tested our system on 1648 text lines and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed date spotting approach."

Recent intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) work has shown that hippocampal activity during encoding predicts subsequent temporal organization of memories [3], supporting a role in contextual binding. It is an open question, however, whether the hippocampus similarly supports contextually mediated processes during retrieval. Here, we analyzed iEEG recordings obtained from 215 epilepsy patients as they performed a free recall task. To identify neural activity specifically associated with contextual retrieval, we compared correct recalls, intrusions (incorrect recall of either items from prior lists or items not previously studied), and deliberations (matched periods during recall when no items came to mind). Neural signals that differentiate correct recalls from both other retrieval classes reflect contextual retrieval, as correct recalls alone arise from the correct context. We found that in the hippocampus, high-frequency activity (HFA, 44\u2013100 Hz), a proxy for neural activation [4], was greater prior to correct recalls relative to the other retrieval classes, with no differentiation between intrusions and deliberations. This pattern was not observed in other memory-related cortical regions, including DLPFC, thus supporting a specific hippocampal contribution to contextually mediated memory retrieval."

One such important function is the retrieval of episodic memories. How hippocampal cells support retrieval of contextual fear memory remains largely unclear. Here we monitored phospho-activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) across neuronal populations of the hippocampus to find that CA1 pyramidal neurons, but not cells in CA3 or dentate gyrus, specifically respond to retrieval of an aversive context. In contrast, retrieval of a neutral context that fails to elicit a threat response did not activate Erk1/2. Moreover, retrieval preferentially re-activated Erk1/2 in the same set of CA1 neurons previously activated during conditioning in a context-specific manner. By confining drug inhibition within dorsal CA1, we established the crucial role for Erk1/2 activity in retrieval of long-term memory, as well as in amygdala activation associated with fear expression. These data provide functional evidence that Erk1/2 signaling in CA1 encodes a specific neural representation of contextual memory with emotional value."

Participants perceived and imagined items in response to cue words and then at test, made recognition judgments in blocks that knowingly contained either a high or low proportion of old to new trials. While participants were indeed more conservative when making judgments about perceived than imagined events, the neuroimaging results demonstrated that response bias and source effects occurred in non-overlapping parietal regions.

Three experiments used self-paced reading and eyetracking to examine the ways in which the retrieval cues provided at a verb characterize subjects. Syntactic theory has identified a number of properties correlated with subjecthood, both phrase-structural and thematic. Findings replicate and extend previous findings of interference at a verb from additional subjects, but indicate that retrieval outcomes are relativized to the syntactic domain in which the retrieval occurs. One, the cues distinguish between thematic subjects in verbal and nominal domains. Two, within the verbal domain, retrieval is sensitive to abstract syntactic properties associated with subjects and their clauses. We argue that the processing at a verb requires cue-driven retrieval, and that the retrieval cues utilize abstract grammatical properties which may reflect parser expectations."

To test this proposal, we compared across three experiments effects of retrieval practice and of restudy trials preceded by context change, employing both recall and item recognition testing. We found retrieval practice to impair both recall and recognition of unpracticed items, which is consistent with prior work. In contrast, restudy preceded by context change impaired recall but not recognition of the items.

The correct conversion of these sources into flat text files is not a trivial task since noise may easily be introduced as a result of spelling or typeset errors. Interestingly, this is not a great drawback when the size of the corpus is sufficiently large, since redundancy helps to overcome noise problems. However, noise becomes a serious problem in restricted-domain Information Retrieval specially when the corpus is small and has little or no redundancy. This paper devises an approach which adds noise-tolerance to Information Retrieval systems. A set of experiments carried out in the agricultural domain proves the effectiveness of the approach presented."

To support the growing complexity of search tasks, researchers in the field of information developed and explored a range of approaches that extend the traditional ad hoc retrieval paradigm. Among these approaches, personalized search systems and exploratory search systems attracted many followers. Personalized search explored the power of artificial intelligence techniques to provide tailored search results according to different user interests, contexts, and tasks. In contrast, exploratory search capitalized on the power of human intelligence by providing users with more powerful interfaces to support the search process. As these approaches are not contradictory, we believe that they can re-enforce each other. We argue that the effectiveness of personalized search systems may be increased by allowing users to interact with the system and learn/investigate the problem in order to reach the final goal. We also suggest that an interactive visualization approach could offer a good ground to combine the strong sides of personalized and exploratory search approaches. This paper proposes a specific way to integrate interactive visualization and personalized search and introduces an adaptive visualization based search system Adaptive VIBE that implements it. We tested the effectiveness of Adaptive VIBE and investigated its strengths and weaknesses by conducting a full-scale user study. The results show that Adaptive VIBE can improve the precision and the productivity of the personalized search system while helping users to discover more diverse sets of information."

We analyze these dependencies and then capture them by using Gaussian copula function. Four copula schemes are developed, and accordingly four KLDs (Kullback-Leibler distances) of the copula schemes are introduced for color texture image retrieval. The evaluations of the proposed method are performed on several color texture databases including two large texture databases ALOT and STex.

        "abstract": "A number of state-of-the-art image retrieval systems have been built upon non-aggregated techniques such as Hamming Embedding (HE) and Selective Match Kernel (SMK). However, the retrieval performances of these techniques are directly affected by the quality of feature matching during the search process. In general, undesirable matched results appear mainly due to the following three aspects: (1) the locality of local features, (2) the quantization errors and (3) the phenomenon of burstiness. In this paper, starting from the framework of SMK, an in-depth study of the integration of Twin Feature (TF) and Similarity Maximal Matching (SMM) is fully investigated. To be specific, two effective modifications based on TF and SMM are proposed to further improve the quality of feature matching. On one hand, the original float vectors of TF are replaced with efficient binary signatures, which achieve relatively high efficiency and comparable accuracy of retrieval. On the other hand, Dynamic Normalization (DN) is designed to effectively control the impact of penalization generated by SMM and improve the performance with almost no extra cost. At last, an efficient image retrieval system is designed and realized based on a cloud-based heterogeneous computing framework through Apache Spark and multiple GPUs to deal with large-scale tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can greatly refine the visual matching process and improve image retrieval results."

SAPHIR operates in six frequencies ranging from 183 \u00b1 0.1 to 183 \u00b1 11 GHz. These frequencies have been used to retrieve cloud ice water path (IWP) at a very high resolution. A method to retrieve IWP over the Indian ocean region is attempted in this study. The study is in two parts, in first part a radiative transfer based simulation is carried out to give an insight of using SAPHIR frequency channels for IWP retrieval, in the next part the real observations of SAPHIR and TRMM-TMI was used for IWP retrieval. The concurrent observations of SAPHIR brightness temperatures (Tbs) and TRMM TMI IWP were used in the development of the retrieval algorithm. An Eigen Vector analysis was done to identify weight of each channel in retrieving IWP; following this a two channel regression based algorithm was developed. The SAPHIR channels which are away from the water vapor absorption band were used to avoid possible water vapor contamination. When the retrieval is compared with independent test dataset, it gives a correlation of 0.80 and RMSE of 3.5%. SAPHIR derived IWP has been compared with other available global IWP products such as TMI, MSPPS, CloudSat and GPM-GMI qualitatively as well as quantitatively. PDF comparison of SAPHIR derived IWP found to have good agreement with CloudSat. Zonal mean comparison with recently launched GMI shows the strength of this algorithm."

The supervised information and the deep architecture are collaboratively explored. Specifically, a deep convolutional network is introduced to learn discriminative feature representations, which are directly used to generate hash codes and predict labels of images. The quantization errors and the prediction errors jointly guide the learning of the deep network. They are highly interrelated and promoted each other. It is worth noting that the proposed method is a general hashing method and can be applied to the general image retrieval task. Extensive experiments on two face image datasets and one general image dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art hashing methods."

In this study, an advanced SWE retrieval algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was developed. This method samples the posterior multiple-layer snow properties according to the likelihood of the brightness temperature (TB) simulation with the actual TB observations. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks with improved Born approximation (MEMLS-IBA) was used as the observation model. Using a globally applicable method to produce prior estimates of snow properties, the retrieval approach is called the Bayesian Algorithm for SWE Estimation with Passive Microwave measurements (BASE-PM), and was applied on 48 snowpits at Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland; Churchill, Canada and Colorado, US. The result shows that the root mean squared (RMS) error of the retrieved SWE is 42.7 mm excluding two outliers, and is 30.8 mm if the outliers as well as six deep snowpits from Colorado are excluded. This accuracy approximately meets the 30-mm requirement of Integrated Global Observing Strategy for shallow snow. The poor performance for the outlier and deep snowpits is explained. Additional experiments using more accurate priors show that SWE retrieval accuracy can be improved with local snowcover knowledge, e.g. if historical snowpit measurements or snow process model simulations are available."

In this paper, we propose histogram feature refinement methods for enhancing performance of texture descriptor based content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. In the proposed approach for histogram refinement, each pixel in the query and database images is classified into one of the two categories based on the analysis of pixel values in its neighborhood. Local patterns corresponding to two sets of pixels are used to generate two histogram features for each image, effectively resulting in splitting of the original global histogram of texture descriptors into two based on the category of each pixel. Resulting histograms are then concatenated to form a single histogram feature. This study also explores three hybrid frameworks for histogram refinement in CBIR systems. Comparison of histogram features corresponding to query and database images are performed using the relative l 1 distance metric. Performance evaluation on three publicly available benchmark image databases namely, GHIM 10000, COREL 1000 database, and Brodatz texture database shows that performances of existing texture descriptor based approaches improve considerably when the proposed histogram feature refinement is incorporated. Specifically, the average precision rate is improved by 6.02%, 5.69%, 4.79%, and 4.21% for LBP, local derivative pattern (LDP), local ternary pattern (LTP), and local tetra pattern (LTrP) descriptors, respectively on GHIM 10000 database.

In the current event-related potential (ERP) study, we sought to find evidence for an involvement of the auditory cortex when subjects attempt to retrieve vocalized information, and hypothesized that adopting retrieval orientation would be beneficial for retrieval accuracy. During study, participants saw object words that they subsequently vocalized or visually imagined. At test, participants had to identify object names of one study condition as targets and to reject object names of the second condition together with new items. Target category switched after half of the test trials. Behaviorally, participants responded less accurately and more slowly to targets of the vocalize condition than to targets of the imagine condition. ERPs to new items varied at a single left electrode (T7) between 500 and 800 ms, indicating a moderate retrieval orientation effect in the subject group as a whole. However, whereas the effect was strongly pronounced in participants with high retrieval accuracy, it was absent in participants with low retrieval accuracy. A current source density (CSD) mapping of the retrieval orientation effect indicated a source over left temporal regions. Independently from retrieval accuracy, the ERP retrieval orientation effect was surprisingly also modulated by test order. Findings are suggestive for an involvement of the auditory cortex in retrieval attempts of vocalized information and confirm that adopting retrieval orientation is potentially beneficial for retrieval accuracy. The effects of test order on retrieval-related processes might reflect a stronger focus on the newness of items in the more difficult test condition when participants started with this condition."

The first step usually consists of identifying candidate genes; to find out which pathways are affected by those genes, however, functional analysis (FA) is mandatory.

Several statistical methods have been developed and compared in terms of computational efficiency and/or statistical appropriateness. However, whether their results are similar or complementary, the sensitivity to parameter settings, or possible bias in the analyzed terms has not been addressed so far. Here, two GSEA and four SEA methods and their parameter combinations were evaluated in six datasets by comparing two breast cancer subtypes with well-known differences in genetic background and patient outcomes. We show that GSEA and SEA lead to different results depending on the chosen statistic, model and/or parameters. Both approaches provide complementary results from a biological perspective. Hence, an Integrative Functional Analysis (IFA) tool is proposed to improve information retrieval in FA. It provides a common gene expression analytic framework that grants a comprehensive and coherent analysis. Only a minimal user parameter setting is required, since the best SEA/GSEA alternatives are integrated. IFA utility was demonstrated by evaluating four prostate cancer and the TCGA breast cancer microarray datasets, which showed its biological generalization capabilities."

Moreover, Manifold Ranking approach can preserve the global topological structure of the data set more effectively than Euclidean Distance-based Ranking approach, which fails to preserve the semantic relevance degree. However, most existing hashing methods ignore the global topological structure of the data set. The key issue is how to incorporate the global topological structure of data set into learning effective hashing function. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing approach, namely Manifold-Ranking Embedded Order Preserving Hashing (MREOPH). A manifold ranking loss is introduced to solve the issue of global topological structure preserving. An order preserving loss is introduced to ensure the consistency between manifold ranking and hamming ranking. A hypercubic quantization loss is introduced to learn discrete binary codes. The information theoretic regularization term is taken into consideration for preserving desirable properties of hash codes.

A sample of 220 university students completed a rule-based learning task, the Posner task, two working memory tasks and two fluid intelligence scales. Fixed-links models were used to separate the core processes representing learning and retrieval from the auxiliary processes and to link them with fluid intelligence. Results showed that the learning and retrieval processes contributed significantly to fluid intelligence (r = 0.38 and \u2212 0.35 respectively).

To support semantic-based multimedia retrieval in big data environment, this paper presents an optimized algorithm called semantic ontology retrieval (SOR), which uses big data processing tools to store and retrieve ontologies from heterogeneous multimedia data. First, the background of semantic extraction and ontology representation for multimedia big data are addressed. Second, the methodology of SOR, including the model definition and retrieval algorithm, is proposed. Third, for parallel processing SOR in distributed nodes, a MapReduce-based retrieval framework is presented. Finally, to achieve high retrieval precision and good user experience, a user feedback scheme is designed. The experimental results illustrate that SOR is suitable for semantic-based retrieval for heterogeneous multimedia big data."

An increase in glucocorticoids, several minutes after stressful events, is described as essential to the impairing retrieval-effects of stressors. Moreover, memory retrieval under stress can have long-term consequences. Through what process does the reactivated memory under stress, despite the disrupting retrieval effects, modify long-term memories? The reconsolidation hypothesis proposes that a previously consolidated memory reactivated by a reminder enters a vulnerability phase (labilization) during which it is transiently sensitive to modulation, followed by a re-stabilization phase. However, previous studies show that the expression of memories during reminder sessions is not a condition to trigger the reconsolidation process since unexpressed memories can be reactivated and labilized. Here we evaluate whether it is possible to reactivate-labilize a memory under the impairing-effects of a mild stressor. We used a paradigm of human declarative memory whose reminder structure allows us to differentiate between a reactivated-labile memory state and a reactivated but non-labile state. Subjects memorized a list of five cue-syllables associated with their respective response-syllables. Seventy-two hours later, results showed that the retrieval of the paired-associate memory was impaired when tested 20 min after a mild stressor (cold pressor stress (CPS)) administration, coincident with cortisol levels increase. Then, we investigated the long-term effects of CPS administration prior to the reminder session. Under conditions where the reminder initiates the reconsolidation process, CPS impaired the long-term memory expression tested 24 h later. In contrast, CPS did not show effects when administered before a reminder session that does not trigger reconsolidation. Results showed that memory reactivation-labilization occurs even when retrieval was impaired. Memory reactivation under stress could hinder -via reconsolidation- the probability of the traces to be expressed in the long term."

        "abstract": "Nowadays, due to the exponential growth of user generated images and videos, there is an increasing interest in learning-based hashing methods. In computer vision, the hash functions are learned in such a way that the hash codes can preserve essential properties of the original space (or label information). Then the Hamming distance of the hash codes can approximate the data similarity. On the other hand, vector quantization methods quantize the data into different clusters based on the criteria of minimal quantization error, and then perform the search using look-up tables. While hashing methods using Hamming distance can achieve faster search speed, their accuracy is often outperformed by quantization methods with the same code length, due to the low quantization error and more flexible distance lookups. To improve the effectiveness of the hashing methods, in this work, we propose Quantization-based Hashing (QBH), a general framework which incorporates the advantages of quantization error reduction methods into conventional property preserving hashing methods. The learned hash codes simultaneously preserve the properties in the original space and reduce the quantization error, and thus can achieve better performance. Furthermore, the hash functions and a quantizer can be jointly learned and iteratively updated in a unified framework, which can be readily used to generate hash codes or quantize new data points. Importantly, QBH is a generic framework that can be integrated to different property preserving hashing methods and quantization strategies, and we apply QBH to both unsupervised and supervised hashing models as showcases in this paper. Experimental results on three large-scale unlabeled datasets (i.e., SIFT1M, GIST1M, and SIFT1B), three labeled datastes (i.e., ESPGAME, IAPRTC and MIRFLICKR) and one video dataset (UQ_VIDEO) demonstrate the superior performance of our QBH over existing unsupervised and supervised hashing methods."

In this paper, we solve this problem by implementing a sparsity regularizer. On one hand, due to the sparse property of the projection matrix, our method effectively lower both the storage and computation cost. On the other hand, we reduce the effective number of parameters involved in the learned projection matrix according to sparsity regularizer, which helps avoid overfitting problem. Without relaxing binary constraints, an iterative scheme jointly optimizing the objective function directly was given, which helps to obtain effective and efficient binary codes.

In fact, the provision of an effective way to retrieve short text presents a significant research challenge owing to several factors: creative language usage, high contextualization, the informal nature of micro blog posts and the limited length of this form of communication. Thus, micro blogging retrieval systems suffer from the problems of data sparseness and the semantic gap. This makes it inadequate to accurately meet users\u2019 information needs because users compose tweets using few terms and without query terms inside; thus, many relevant tweets will not be retrieved. To overcome the problems of data sparseness and the semantic gap, recent studies on content-based microblog searching have focused on adding semantics to micro posts by linking short text to knowledge bases resources. Moreover, previous studies use bag-of-concepts representation by linking named entities to their corresponding knowledge base concepts. However, bag-of-concepts representation considers only concepts that match named entities and supposes that all concepts are equivalent and independent. Thus, in this paper, we present a graph-of-concepts method that considers the relationships among concepts that match named entities in short text and their related concepts and contextualizes each concept in the graph by leveraging the linked nature of DBpedia as a Linked Open Data knowledge base and graph-based centrality theory. Furthermore, we propose a similarity measure that computes the similarity between two graphs (query-tweet) by considering the relationships between the contextualized concepts. Finally, we introduce some experiment results, using a real Twitter dataset, to expose the effectiveness of our system."

Geophysical products such as soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth at nadir (\u03c4nad) are retrieved by an operational algorithm using TB observations at different angles of incidence and polarizations. However, the quality of the retrievals depends on several surface effects, such as vegetation, soil roughness and texture, etc. In the microwave forward emission model used in the retrievals (L-band Microwave Emission Model, L-MEB), soil roughness is modelled with a semi-empirical equation using four main parameters (Qr, Hr, Nrp, with p = H or V polarizations). At present, these parameters are calibrated with data provided by airborne studies and in situ measurements made at a local scale that is not necessarily representative of the large SMOS footprints (43 km on average) at global scale. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the calibrated values of Nrp and Hr on the SM and \u03c4nad retrievals based on SMOS TB measurements (SMOS Level 3 product) over the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) network located in North America over five years (2011\u20132015). In this study, Qr was set equal to zero and we assumed that NrH = NrV. The retrievals were performed by varying Nrp from \u22121 to 2 by steps of 1 and Hr from 0 to 0.6 by steps of 0.1. At satellite scale, the results show that combining vegetation and roughness effects in a single parameter provides the best results in terms of soil moisture retrievals, as evaluated against the in situ SM data. Even though our retrieval approach was very simplified, as we did not account for pixel heterogeneity, the accuracy we obtained in the SM retrievals was almost systematically better than those of the Level 3 product. Improved results were also obtained in terms of optical depth retrievals. These new results may have key consequences in terms of calibration of roughness effects within the algorithms of the SMOS (ESA) and the SMAP (NASA) space missions."

Recently proposed instrument concepts for stratospheric aerosol profiling have been designed to measure the linearly polarized radiance. Yet, to date, the impact of the polarized measurement on the retrievals has not been systematically studied. Here we use a fully spherical, multiple scattering radiative transfer model to perform a sensitivity study on the effects of the polarized measurement on stratospheric aerosol extinction retrievals through specific investigations of the aerosol signal fraction in polarized measurements, potential retrieval bias, and achievable precision. In this study,we simulate both total and linearly polarized measurements, for a wide range of limb viewing geometries that are encountered in typical low earth orbits and for various aerosol loading scenarios. The orientation of the linear polarization with respect to the horizon is also studied. Taking into account instrument signal to noise levels it is found that in general, the linear polarization can be used as effectively as the total radiance measurement, with consideration of instrument signal to noise capabilities; however the horizontal polarization is more promising in terms of signal magnitude."

To address these challenges and bridge the semantic gap more efficiently. We proposed a method named kernel based latent semantic sparse hashing (KLSSH) in this paper.

More specifically, KLSSH firstly employs sparse coding for obtaining primary latent features of image and matrix factorization for generating features of text concepts to learn latent semantic features in a high level abstraction space. Next, it maps the latent semantic feature to compact binary codes using kernel method. Kernel scheme ensures to sequentially and efficiently train the hash functions one bit at a time and then generate very short and discriminative hash codes. Moreover, it reduces the quantization loss obviously at the same time and makes the retrieval performance better.

Recent efforts of exploiting sparsity were developed to improve the performance of PR algorithms, such as the reconstruction quality, robustness to noise, and convergence behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsity-based algorithm, which can adaptively learn an orthogonal sparsifying transform, and reconstruct the image simultaneously from the Fourier magnitudes. However, the estimated images at the early iterations are extremely bad. Training samples from these images cannot provide much useful information for sparsifying transform learning. To avoid unnecessary updating, an orthogonal sparsifying transform learning method based on transfer learning is proposed. Through transfer learning, we transfer the fixed sparsifying transform to an adaptive one. We apply this new sparsifying transform learning method to PR, and exploit the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to solve the formulated problem. Since the learnt sparsifying transform is adaptive to data, it favors better sparsity. Using this learnt sparsifying transform for image reconstruction can improve the reconstruction quality at low oversampling ratios. Experimental results show that the proposed PR algorithm can improve nearly 6 dB compared with the recently proposed PR-TIHP- l 1 algorithm in terms of the average PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) at oversampling ratio 2.47, 2.53, 2.59. Moreover, our algorithm is robust to noise and has better convergence behavior heuristically."

        "abstract": "Learning based hashing methods, which aim at learning similarity-preserving binary codes for efficient nearest neighbor search, have been actively studied recently. A majority of the approaches address hashing problems for image collections. However, due to the extra temporal information, videos are usually represented by much higher dimensional (thousands or even more) features compared with images, causing high computational complexity for conventional hashing schemes. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient hashing scheme for high-dimensional video data. This method, called Disaggregation Hashing (DH), exploits the correlations among different feature dimensions. An intuitive feature disaggregation method is first proposed, followed by a novel hashing algorithm based on different feature clusters. Additionally, a kernelized version of DH is proposed for better performance. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method by theoretical analysis and exploring its application on action retrieval from video databases. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our binary coding scheme over state-of-the-art hashing methods."

The three-dimensional shape contains various useful information including visual information, geometric relationships, and other type properties. Thus the strategy of exploring these characteristics is the core of extracting effective 3D shape features. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D feature learning framework which combines different modality data effectively to promote the discriminability of uni-modal feature by using deep learning. The geometric information and visual information are extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (CDBNs), respectively, and then two independent Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are employed to learn high-level features from geometric and visual features. Finally, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is trained for mining the deep correlations between different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better performance."

Evidence for this has been obtained from a paradigm involving independent cues in which participants initially learn cue-target pairs through retrieval (Mother: _____) or restudying (Mother: Child), and later show stronger benefits of retrieval over restudy in recalling targets from final test cues that are strongly related to the original cue (Father: _____) compared to cues that are unrelated to the original cues (Birth: _____). The current study used a new paradigm to explore the role of mediators in learning from retrieval by comparing the advantage of retrieval over restudying for cue-target pairs that varied in mediator strength (i.e., the strength of the strongest first associate to the cue). Across three experiments, items higher in mediator strength (e.g., Chalk: Crayon, with Chalk producing its strongest first associate Board at a rate of .69) produced stronger testing effects than items lower in mediator strength (e.g., Soup: Onion, with Soup producing its strongest first associate Chicken at a rate of .10). Item analyses revealed that mediator strength was positively associated with final test recall of items learned through retrieval but not through restudying, and this relationship held after controlling for other linguistic properties of the cues."

However, the mechanisms that serve the retrieval of remote memories, has not yet been fully understood. Some evidences suggest that the central cholinergic system appears be involved in the modulation of these processes. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of a pre-test administration of dicyclomine, a high-affinity M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist, on the retrieval of remote memories in fear conditioning and IA tasks. Male Wistar rats were trained, and after 1 or 28 days, the rats received dicyclomine (16 or 32 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) and were tested in CFC, tone fear conditioning (TFC) and IA tasks. At both time intervals, 32 mg/kg dicyclomine induced impairment of CFC. In TFC task only the performance of the rats 28 days after training was impaired. The IA task was not affected in any of the studied intervals. These findings suggest a differential contribution of muscarinic receptors on recent and remote memories retrieval revealing a more generalized role in remote memory."

From the research literature, there seems to be a need for a tool which can provide an easy interface for complex queries in natural language that can retrieve the domain-specific information from the ontology. This research paper proposes an IRSCSD system (Information retrieval system for computer science domain) as a solution. This system offers advanced querying and browsing of structured data with search results automatically aggregated and rendered directly in a consistent user-interface, thus reducing the manual effort of users. So, the main objective of this research is design and development of semantic web-based system for integrating ontology towards domain-specific retrieval support. Methodology followed is a piecemeal research which involves the following stages. First Stage involves the designing of framework for semantic web-based system. Second stage builds the prototype for the framework using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tool. Third Stage deals with the natural language query conversion into SPARQL query language using Python-based QUEPY framework. Fourth Stage involves firing of converted SPARQL queries to the ontology through Apache's Jena API to fetch the results. Lastly, evaluation of the prototype has been done in order to ensure its efficiency and usability. Thus, this research paper throws light on framework development for semantic web-based system that assists in efficient retrieval of domain-specific information, natural language query interpretation into semantic web language, creation of domain-specific ontology and its mapping with related ontology. This research paper also provides approaches and metrics for ontology evaluation on prototype ontology developed to study the performance based on accessibility of required domain-related information."

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that directing attention toward single item-context associations during encoding improves young and older adults' context memory performance and reduces demands on executive functions during retrieval. In everyday situations, there are many event features competing for our attention, and our ability to successfully recover those details may depend on our ability to ignore others. Failures of selective attention may contribute to older adults' context memory impairments. In the current electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we assessed the effects of age on processes supporting successful context memory retrieval of selectively attended features as indexed by neural oscillations. During encoding, young and older adults were directed to attend to a picture of an object and its relationship to one of two concurrently presented contextual details: a color or scene. At retrieval, we tested their memory for the object, its attended and unattended context features, and their confidence for both the attended and unattended features. Both groups showed greater memory for attended than unattended contextual features. However, older adults showed evidence of hyper-binding between attended and unattended context features while the young adults did not. EEG results in the theta band suggest that young and older adults recollect similar amounts of information but brain-behavior correlations suggest that this information was supportive of contextual memory performance, particularly for young adults. By contrast, sustained beta desynchronization, indicative of sensory reactivation and episodic reconstruction, was correlated with contextual memory performance for older adults only. We conclude that older adults' inhibition deficits during encoding reduced the selectivity of their contextual memories, which led to reliance on executive functions like episodic reconstruction to support successful memory retrieval."

The image is divided into two different components, for which encryption and feature extraction are executed separately. As a result, cloud server can extract features from an encrypted image directly and compare them with the features of the queried images, so that users can thus obtain the image. Different from other methods, the proposed method has no special requirements to encryption algorithms, which makes it more universal and can be applied in different scenarios. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve better security and better retrieval performance."

Documents with different formats may express similar semantic information, thus, searching documents reflecting users\u05f3 intention has been a crucial and important task. For solving this problem, this paper proposes a novel semantic-based heterogeneous transportation media retrieval (TMR) approach to improve the performance. TMR supports the function of retrieving various media types such as image, video, audio and text by using a single media type. Firstly, semantic fields are extracted from the user annotating and automatic learning to express the users\u05f3 intention. Secondly, ontology is used to represent the semantic fields of a media, and the ontology represented semantic information is saved together with the media document data. Thirdly, the semantic field adjustment process is described. Finally, fuzzy matching is employed to measure the similarity between the users\u05f3 intention and media documents. For the returned results, we carry out the performance evaluation models in comparison with the existing approaches. Experimental result indicates the superiority of TMR in term of precision rate, computing speed, storage cost and user experience."

It is of considerable challenge to stride across the heterogeneous gap between modalities. Existing methods project different modalities into a common space by minimizing the distance within the heterogeneous pairs (intra-pair) of the new latent space. However, the relationship among these multi-modal pairs (inter-pair) are neglected, which are beneficial to eliminate the heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on canonical correlation analysis by considering the high-order relationship among pairs (HCCA) for cross-modal retrieval. Supervised with additional semantic labels and unsupervised without semantic labels are simultaneously considered by treating the intra- and inter-pair correlation discriminatively. Moreover, kernel tricks are also performed on HCCA to learn a non-linear projection, termed HKCCA. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in cross modal retrieval."

Finally, a short-term relevance feedback scheme is defined where queries can be initialised with samples from inside or outside the database. Several retrieval simulations have been carried out using three databases and seven different ranking functions to test the performance of the presented approach.

This chapter reviews more recent work, in which it is demonstrated that selective memory retrieval has two faces and that it can both impair and improve recall of other items. In this recent work, participants' access to study context during selective retrieval was experimentally manipulated and it was examined whether such manipulation influences the effects of selective retrieval. Access to study context was manipulated using listwise directed forgetting, context-dependent forgetting and time-dependent forgetting. The results consistently showed that selective retrieval impairs recall of other memories if access to study context during retrieval is largely maintained, but that selective retrieval can improve recall if study context access is impaired. The findings are explained by a two-factor account, which claims that, in general, selective retrieval does not only trigger inhibition and blocking but also triggers context reactivation processes. The proposal is that primarily inhibition and blocking operate when study context access during selective retrieval is largely maintained, whereas primarily context reactivation processes operate when study context access is impaired. Current findings on the two faces of selective retrieval are well consistent with this theoretical view."

During each level in the high authentication process, any 2 or more participants can be gathered to reconstruct the original meaningful certification images. While in the case of each level in the low authentication process, only one authenticator who possesses a correct pair of SIKs, will gain no significant information of certification image; however, it can result in a remarkable peak output in the nonlinear correlation coefficient of the recovered image and the standard certification image, which can successfully provide an additional authentication layer for the high-level authentication.

A straightforward methodology that can protect data privacy is to encrypt the data before outsourcing. Recently, many searchable encryption schemes have been proposed to allow users to execute keyword-based search over encrypted data. However, it is different for users to exactly find all the interested files from the huge amounts of data by relying solely on keyword-based search. In information retrieval domain, full-text retrieval is an efficient information retrieval technology that allows efficient searches over massive amount of web data. Unfortunately, when applied in the cloud paradigm, full-text retrieval over encrypted cloud data have not been well studied. The full-text retrieval service requires extracting all the words in the contents of documents. The huge scale of index words cannot be efficiently supported by the existing searchable encryption schemes. Moreover, to protect user\u2019s privacy, a privacy-preserved full-text retrieval index is required. These problems make efficient full-text retrieval over a large amount of encrypted cloud data a very challenging task. In this paper, we first establish a set of strict privacy requirements for full-text retrieval in cloud storage systems. To address the challenging problem, we design a Bloom filter based tree index. Our scheme fine-tunes the similarity between the query and encrypted documents by proposing the membership entropies of index words. Our scheme is provably secure through our security analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through extensive experimental evaluation. The experimental results manifest the search operation can be done in 60 milliseconds using an off-the-shelf moderate PC."

        "abstract": "Traditional summarization methods only use the internal information of a Web document while ignoring its social information such as tweets from Twitter, which can provide a perspective viewpoint for readers towards an event. This paper proposes a framework named SoRTESum to take the advantages of social information such as document content reflection to extract summary sentences and social messages. In order to do that, the summarization was formulated in two steps: scoring and ranking. In the scoring step, the score of a sentence or social message is computed by using intra-relation and inter-relation which integrate the support of local and social information in a mutual reinforcement form. To calculate these relations, 16 features are proposed. After scoring, the summarization is generated by selecting top m ranked sentences and social messages. SoRTESum was extensively evaluated on two datasets. Promising results show that: (i) SoRTESum obtains significant improvements of ROUGE-scores over state-of-the-art baselines and competitive results with the learning to rank approach trained by RankBoost and (ii) combining intra-relation and inter-relation benefits single-document summarization."

Neuroimaging studies, which have previously encouraged such strategies, find similar patterns of brain regions involved in both temporal and non-temporal context memory. The present study aims to investigate whether previous findings are driven by the use of non-temporal strategies or whether the same pattern of brain regions is identified when relative familiarity and semantic narrative strategies are discouraged. We used abstract phrases (e.g. alone me leave) created by scrambling familiar three-word phrases. The words in the phrases were less concrete than the object image stimuli used in previous studies of temporal context memory (Jenkins and Ranganath, 2010) and were presented quickly while participants read each word aloud. This differed from previous studies in which participants were encouraged to use narrative strategies during encoding (Tubridy and Davachi, 2011) and was designed to discourage use of narrative strategies. The relative familiarity of the words within each phrase was similar and likely not diagnostic of word order during encoding, in order to minimize the use of relative familiarity strategies. Neuroimaging results indicate that temporal context retrieval was associated with the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, which are regions consistent with the retrieval of non-temporal context in episodic memory, suggesting that previous findings were not driven entirely by non-temporal strategies but rather that temporal memory relies on similar brain regions to non-temporal memory."

Here, two dimensional Hilbert transform based phase retrieval method is adopted in cellular phase imaging, it not only reserves more sample specifics compared to classical fast Fourier transform based method, but also overcomes disadvantages of traditional algorithm according to Hilbert transform which is a one dimensional processing causing phase ambiguities. Both simulations and experiments are provided, proving the proposed phase retrieval approach can acquire quantitative sample phases with high accuracy and fast speed."

However, recent research (Uzer, Lee, &amp; Brown, 2012) shows that direct retrieval of autobiographical memories, in response to word cues, is common. This invites the question of whether direct retrieval phenomenon is generalizable beyond the standard laboratory paradigm. Here we investigated prevalence of direct retrieval of autobiographical memories cued by specific and individuated cues versus generic cues. In Experiment 1, participants retrieved memories in response to cues from their own life (e.g., the names of friends) and generic words (e.g., chair). In Experiment 2, participants provided their personal cues two or three months prior to coming to the lab (min: 75 days; max: 100 days). In each experiment, RT was measured and participants reported whether memories were directly retrieved or generated on each trial. Results showed that personal cues elicited a high rate of direct retrieval. Personal cues were more likely to elicit direct retrieval than generic word cues, and as a consequence, participants responded faster, on average, to the former than to the latter. These results challenge the constructive view of autobiographical memory and suggest that autobiographical memories consist of pre-stored event representations, which are largely governed by associative mechanisms. These demonstrations offer theoretically interesting questions such as why are we not overwhelmed with directly retrieved memories cued by everyday familiar surroundings?"

Under such circumstance, much research attention has been spent on 3D model retrieval in recent decades. Although extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this task, it is a difficult task to explore the correlation among 3D models, which is the key issue in 3D model retrieval. In this paper, we design and implement a constructive-learning for cross-model correlation algorithm for 3D model retrieval. In this method, we first extract view features from multi-views of 3D models. To exploit the cross-model correlation, we formulate the correlation of 3D models in a hypergraph structure, where both the vertex correlation and the edge correlation are simultaneously learned in a constructive-learning process. Then, the correlation of each model to the query can be used for retrieval. To justify the performance of our proposed algorithm, we have implemented the method and tested on two datasets. We have compared it with recent state-of-the-art methods, and the results have shown superior performance of our proposed method."

However, the complexity and the degree of specialization of the language used by the experts in this context, make this task both challenging and complex. In this work, we introduce a novel experimental study to evaluate the performance of the two semantic similarity metrics (Path and Intrinsic IC-Path, both widely accepted in the literature) in a real-life information retrieval situation. In order to achieve this goal and due to the lack of methodologies for this context in the literature, we propose a straightforward information retrieval system for the biomedical field based on the UMLS Metathesaurus and on semantic similarity metrics. In contrast with previous studies which focus on testbeds with limited and controlled sets of concepts, we use a large amount of information (101,712 medical documents extracted from TREC Medical Records Track 2011). Our results show that in real-life cases, both metrics display similar performance, Path (F-Measure = 0.430) e Intrinsic IC-Path (F-Measure = 0.427). Thereby we suggest that the use of Intrinsic IC-Path is not justified in real scenarios."

The problem is formulated as R simultaneous sparse approximations of multiple 1-D signals. To get a method able to handle large size signals while maintaining a sufficient resolution, a multigrid dictionary refinement technique is associated to the simultaneous sparse approximation. The refinement procedure is proved to converge in the single R-D mode case. Then, for the general multiple modes case, the signal tensor model is decomposed in order to handle each mode separately in an iterative scheme. The proposed method does not require an association step since the estimated modes are automatically \u201cpaired\u201d. We also derive the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bounds of the parameters of modal R-D signals. The expressions are given in compact form in the single tone case.

In this paper such a platform is presented. It encompasses multiple PMUs from different vendors, manages detailed information about the measurement chain and its associated uncertainties and exploits a unique communication infrastructure with OpenPDC as the underlying layer for data fusion. It is based on a powerful Java EE7 application that extends OpenPDC and represents the environment for extracting, managing and processing the information. The Java EE7 application has been developed aiming for security, scalability, portability, concurrent access and big data processing.

Our framework utilizes the wavelet packet (WP) method to the blind source separation (BSS) based harmonic retrieval model. Firstly, we establish the BSS based harmonic retrieval model in additive noise using only one mixed channel signal, at the same time, the fundamental principle of BSS based harmonics retrieval algorithm is analyzed in detail. Then, the harmonic retrieval algorithm is developed mainly using the WP decomposition approach, where the criterion is formed as the cumulant based approximation of the mutual information (MI) for the selection of optimal sub-bands of WP decomposition with the least-dependent components between the same nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to retrieve the harmonic source signals and yield good performance."

Clients arriving at the network are interested in retrieving measurements from an arbitrary set of sensors of some fixed size s. We show that the sensors broadcast measurements according to a phase-type distribution. We determine the probability distribution of the time needed for a client to retrieve s sensor measurements. We provide a closed-form expression for the retrieval time of s sensor measurements for an asymptotically large capacity of the sensor battery or the rate at which energy is harvested. We also analyze numerically the retrieval time of s sensor measurements under various assumptions regarding the battery capacity of the sensors, the energy harvesting and consumption processes. The results provide a lower bound for the energy storage capacity of the sensors for which the retrieval time of measurements is below a targeted level. It is also shown that the ratio between the energy harvesting rate and the broadcasting rate significantly influences the retrieval time of measurements, whereas deploying sensors with large batteries does not significantly reduce the retrieval time of measurements. Numerical experiments also indicate that our theoretical results generalize to non-identical energy harvesting rates, various amount of energy consumed upon a broadcast and non-exponential distributions of the energy harvesting and broadcasting processes."

In comparison with the existing approaches, the proposed algorithm achieves a number of advantages, which can be highlighted as: (i) interpretation of users\u2019 feedback is independent of both the content features and relevance feedback schemes, and hence the proposed algorithm can be applicable to any content features and relevance feedback methods; (ii) the RF interpretation is followed by a group of swarmed particles, acting as multiple agents rather than a single query image in searching for the desirable images; (iii) the proposed RF interpretation and learning is exploited not only in reweighting the content similarity measurement, but also in regrouping the database images. Extensive experiments support that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing representative techniques, providing good potential for further research and development for a wide range of content-based image retrieval applications."

Researchers have found that utilizing the topic information generated through topic modeling together with traditional TF-IDF information generates superior results in document retrieval. However, in order to apply this idea to real-life IR systems, some critical problems need to be solved: how to store the topic information and how to utilize it with the TF-IDF information for efficient document retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Topic Enhanced Inverted Index (TEII) to incorporate the topic information into the inverted index for efficient top-k document retrieval. Specifically, we explore two different types of TEIIs. We first propose the incremental TEII, which includes the topic information into the traditional inverted index by adding topic-based inverted lists. The incremental TEII is beneficial for legacy IR systems, since it does not change the existing TF-IDF-based inverted lists. As a more flexible alternative, we propose the hybrid TEII to incorporate the topic information into each posting of the inverted index. In the hybrid TEII, two relaxation methods are proposed to support dynamic estimation of the upper bound impact of each posting. The hybrid TEII is highly extensible for incorporating different ranking factors and we show an extension of the hybrid TEII by considering the static quality of the documents in the corpus. Based on the incremental and hybrid TEIIs, we develop several query processing algorithms to support efficient top-k document retrieval on TEIIs. Empirical evaluation on the TREC dataset verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed index structures and query processing algorithms."

We argue that offline annotation and online retrieval models should be regarded as a unified long-term learner to reinforce each other. Based on this viewpoint, this paper presents an annotation-retrieval reinforcement framework, in which a dual-structured learning model is presented: the keyword-image association is learned by semantic manifold modeling while the semantic correlation between keywords is learned by Image-Word Net modeling. In keyword-image association modeling level, to effectively model keyword-image manifold, we present a manifold co-training algorithm to address the sample insufficiency problem. In manifold-based image annotation, we view annotation process as semantic feature reduction in keyword space, based on which a Biased Fisher Discriminant Analysis (BFDA) algorithm is presented for Eigen feature (keyword) selection. In semantic correlation modeling level, a novel Image-Word Net is learned from annotation training set and users' retrieval log for (1) irrelevant annotated keyword pruning; (2) semantic-level retrieval enhancement. In retrieval, our framework can effectively reveal user target by improving traditional content-based relevance feedback to linguistic-level interaction using annotation information, based on which BFDA is adopted for keyword selection. Finally, user interaction logs are adopted for manifold model updating and annotation refinement. As presented in our experiments, proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art annotation and retrieval algorithms in COREL Image databases with over 10,000 general-purpose images."

Although MERIS was limited in spectral coverage, accurate Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) from MERIS data are retrieved by using appropriate additional information. We introduce a new AOT retrieval algorithm for MERIS over land surfaces, referred to as eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER). XBAER is similar to the \u201cdark-target\u201d (DT) retrieval algorithm used for Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in that it uses a lookup table (LUT) to match to satellite-observed reflectance and derive the AOT. Instead of a global parameterization of surface spectral reflectance, XBAER uses a set of spectral coefficients to prescribe surface properties. In this manner, XBAER is not limited to dark surfaces (vegetation) and retrieves AOT over bright surface (desert, semiarid, and urban areas). Preliminary validation of the MERIS-derived AOT and the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements yield good agreement, the resulting regression equation is y = (0.92x \u00b1 0.07) + (0.05 \u00b1 0.01) and Pearson correlation coefficient of R = 0.78.

The proposed methodology is based on the inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model through the state-of-the-art nonlinear Gaussian process regression (GPR) method. Landsat and SPOT5 data were used for multitemporal LAI retrievals at high-resolution. LAI estimates were validated using time series of in situ LAI measurements collected during the rice season in Spain and Italy. Ground LAI data were collected with smartphones using PocketLAI, a specific phone application for LAI estimation. Temporal evolution of the LAI estimates using Landsat and SPOT5 data followed consistently the temporal evolution of the in situ LAI measurements acquired on several Mediterranean rice varieties. The estimates had a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.39 and 0.51 m2/m2 in Spain and 0.38 and 0.47 m2/m2 in Italy for Landsat and SPOT5 respectively, with a strong correlation (R2 &gt; 0.92) for both cases. Spatial-temporal assessment of the estimated LAI from Landsat and SPOT5 data confirmed the robustness and consistency of the retrieval chain. This paper demonstrates the importance of an adequate characterization of the underlying rice background in order to address changes in background condition related to water management. Results highlight the potential of the proposed chain for deriving multitemporal near real-time decametric LAI maps fundamental for operational rice crop monitoring, and demonstrate the readiness of the proposed method for the processing of data such as the recently launched Sentinel-2."

The standard local binary patterns (LBPs) and local ternary patterns (LTPs) encode the gray scale relationship between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in two dimensional (2D) local region of an image whereas the proposed method encodes the spatial relation between any pair of neighbors in a local region along the given directions (i.e., 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 135\u00b0) for a given center pixel in an image. The novelty of the proposed method is it uses ternary patterns from horizontal\u2013vertical\u2013diagonal\u2013antidiagonal (HVDA7) structure of directional local extrema values of an image to encode more spatial structure information which lead to better retrieval. DLTerQEP also provides a significant increase in discriminative power by allowing larger local pattern neighborhoods. The experiments have been carried out for proving the worth of proposed algorithm on three different types of benchmark biomedical databases; (i) computed tomography (CT) scanned lung image databases named as LIDC-IDRI-CT and VIA/I-ELCAP-CT, (ii) brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) database named as OASIS-MRI. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) over state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques like LBP, LTP and LQEP etc."

To address this issue, rather than using image-to-image similarity, we propose a simple yet effective retrieval method based on exploring the image-to-class similarity. The method uses an iterative framework, where the size of the query class is progressively enlarged according to the previous retrieval results, and the ranked list is generated according to the similarities between the images in the database and the query class.

A central issue associated with this task is how to effectively and efficiently describe the leaf images and measure their similarities. In this paper, a novel shape descriptor termed R-angle is proposed. R-angle describes the curvature of the contour by measuring the angle between the intersections of the shape contour with a circle of radius R centered at points sampled around the contour. It is intrinsically invariant to group transforms including scaling, rotation and translation. Varying the parameter R of the proposed R-angle naturally introduces the notation of scale, which we leverage to provide a coarse-to-fine description of the local curvature. A local scale arrangement is proposed by taking the distance between each contour point and the center of the shape to be the maximum scale for a given contour point. Two matching schemes, including L1-norm matching and dynamic programming based matching, are applied to measure the similarities of the leaf shapes. The retrieval experiments conducted on two challenging leaf image datasets indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for leaf identification. An additional experiment on an animal dataset also indicates its potential for general shape recognition."

        "abstract": "A significant effort by researchers has advanced the ability of computers to understand, index and annotate images. This entails automatic domain specific knowledge-base (KB) construction and metadata extraction from visual information and any associated textual information. However, it is challenging to fuse visual and textual information and build a complete domain-specific KB for image annotation due to several factors such as: the ambiguity of natural language to describe image features; the semantic gap when using image features to represent visual content and the incompleteness of the metadata in the KB. Typically the KB is based upon a domain specific Ontology. However, it is not an easy task to extract the data needed from annotations and images, and then to automatically process these and transform them into an integrated Ontology model, because of the ambiguity of terms and because of image processing algorithm errors. As such, it is difficult to construct a complete KB covering a specific domain of knowledge. This paper presents a Multi-Modal Incompleteness Ontology-based (MMIO) system for image retrieval based upon fusing two derived indices. The first index exploits low-level features extracted from images. A novel technique is proposed to represent the semantics of visual content, by restructuring visual word vectors into an Ontology model by computing the distance between the visual word features and concept features, the so called concept range. The second index relies on a textual description which is processed to extract and recognise the concepts, properties, or instances that are defined in an Ontology. The two indexes are fused into a single indexing model, which is used to enhance the image retrieval efficiency. Nonetheless, this rich index may not be sufficient to find the desired images. Therefore, a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) algorithm is exploited to search for similar words to those used in a query. As a result, it is possible to retrieve images with a query using (similar) words that do not appear in the caption. The efficiency of the KB is validated experimentally with respect to three criteria, correctness, multimodality, and robustness. The results show that the multi-modal metadata in the proposed KB could be utilised efficiently. An additional experiment demonstrates that LSI can handle an incomplete KB effectively. Using LSI, the system can still retrieve relevant images when information in the Ontology is missing, leading to an enhanced retrieval performance."

Different from the traditional encryption system, the encrypted image of this system is a color image and the plaintext of it is a gray image, which can achieve the combination of a color image and a gray image and the conversion of one image to another image. Phase masks can be generated by using the phase iterative algorithms in this paper. The six phase masks and the six diffracting distances are all essential keys in the process of decryption, which can greatly enhance the system security.

Administrative documents commonly contain some salient entities such as logos, stamps or seals as the means of their authentication and proprietorship. These salient entities provide quite discriminative information, which can effectively be used for different tasks of document image retrieval, classification and recognition in document-based applications. Thus, proper detection/recognition of these entities in document images increases the performance of such applications in terms of document retrieval, classification, and recognition. To present the state-of-the-art research on the retrieval of administrative document images, this paper deals with a survey of administrative document image retrieval in relation to seals and logos. All the available datasets, feature extraction and classification techniques for logo and seal detection/recognition are discussed systematically. The shortcomings of the present technologies on logo and seal based document processing are also highlighted. Avenues of the future works are further given for the benefit of readers.

        "abstract": "Hashing techniques have been widely applied in the large-scale cross-view retrieval tasks due to the significant advantage of hash codes in computation and storage efficiency. Most existing cross-view hashing methods can only handle fully-paired scenarios, where all samples from different views are paired. However, such full pairwise correspondences may not be available in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing method, named semi-paired hashing (SPH), to deal with a more challenging cross-view retrieval task, where only partial pairwise correspondences are provided in advance. Specifically, SPH aims to preserve within-view similarity and cross-view correlation among multi-view data. Similarity structure within each view is obtained via anchor graph. As limited samples are paired, correlation between unpaired samples is exploited via a simple yet effective approach, which estimates cross-view correlation by partial cross-view pairwise information and within-view similarity structure. Besides, we further incorporate two regression terms between original features and target binary codes to reduce the quantization loss. An efficient iterative algorithm is presented to simultaneously solve hash functions and binary codes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SPH over the state-of-the-art methods, especially in the semi-paired scenarios."

The cloud retrieval algorithm combines local and global optimization routines, and yields a retrieval accuracy of about 1% and a fast computational time. Retrieved parameters are the cloud optical thickness and the cloud-top height. It was found that the use of the independent pixel approximation instead of the stochastic cloud model leads to large errors in the retrieved cloud parameters, as well as, in the retrieved ozone height resolved partial columns.

In the first stage, we propose a margin-based objective to find approximate hash codes such that a pair of hash codes associating to a pair of similar (dissimilar) images has sufficiently small (large) Hamming distance. This objective results in a challenging optimization problem. We develop a coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently solve this optimization problem. In the second stage, we use convolutional neural networks to learn hash functions. We conduct extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets with different kinds of images.

        "abstract": "Nowadays the amount of multimedia data such as images and text is growing exponentially on social websites, arousing the demand of effective and efficient cross-modal retrieval. The cross-modal hashing based methods have attracted considerable attention recently as they can learn efficient binary codes for heterogeneous data, which enables large-scale similarity search. Generally, to effectively construct the cross-correlation between different modalities, these methods try to find a joint abstraction space where the heterogeneous data can be projected. Then a quantization rule is applied to convert the abstraction representation to binary codes. However, these methods may not effectively bridge the semantic gap through the latent abstraction space because they fail to capture latent information between heterogeneous data. In addition, most of these methods apply the simplest quantization scheme (i.e. sign function) which may cause information loss of the abstraction representation and result in inferior binary codes. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel cross-modal hashing based method that generates unified binary codes combining different modalities. Specifically, we first extract semantic features from the modalities of images and text to capture latent information. Then these semantic features are projected to a joint abstraction space. Finally, the abstraction space is rotated to produce better unified binary codes with much less quantization loss, while preserving the locality structure of projected data. We integrate the binary code learning procedures above to develop an iterative algorithm for optimal solutions. Moreover, we further exploit the useful class label information to reduce the semantic gap between different modalities to benefit the binary code learning. Extensive experiments on four multimedia datasets show that the proposed binary coding schemes outperform several other state-of-the-art methods under cross-modal scenarios."

Different heuristic strategies are introduced for making the assignments, while a general mathematical model and efficient branch and bound procedure are proposed for optimizing the sequence. Additionally, a fast metaheuristic capable of solving larger instances is also developed. A set of real-world based benchmarks with varying characteristics is generated to evaluate the proposed methods.

In addition, psychosocial stress impaired memory retrieval in both the GSP and NA groups, with no differences between them. Regarding the sex factor, no effects were found in the cortisol response to the TSST. However, during the encoding session, GSP men had higher cortisol levels than GSP women and NA subjects. There was also a significant interaction between sex and stress exposure on memory retrieval.

Local descriptors are first extracted via the spectral graph wavelet transform having the Mexican hat wavelet as a generating kernel. Then, mid-level features are obtained by embedding local descriptors into the visual vocabulary space using the soft-assignment coding step of the bag-of-features model. A global descriptor is subsequently constructed by aggregating mid-level features weighted by a geodesic exponential kernel, resulting in a matrix representation that describes the frequency of appearance of nearby codewords in the vocabulary. Then, we compare the global descriptor of a query to all global descriptors of the shapes in the dataset using a dissimilarity measure and find the closest shape.

Although age-related functional changes in the brain regions supporting context memory begin at midlife, little is known about the functional changes with age that support context memory encoding and retrieval across the adult lifespan. We investigated how age-related functional changes support context memory across the adult lifespan by assessing linear changes with age during successful context encoding and retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compared young, middle-aged and older adults during both encoding and retrieval of spatial and temporal details of faces. Multivariate behavioral partial least squares (B-PLS) analysis of fMRI data identified a pattern of whole-brain activity that correlated with a linear age term and a pattern of whole-brain activity that was associated with an age-by-memory phase (encoding vs. retrieval) interaction. Further investigation of this latter effect identified three main findings: 1) reduced phase-related modulation in bilateral fusiform gyrus, left superior/anterior frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus that started at midlife and continued to older age, 2) reduced phase-related modulation in bilateral inferior parietal lobule that occurred only in older age, and 3) changes in phase-related modulation in older but not younger adults in left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus that was indicative of age-related over-recruitment. We conclude that age-related reductions in context memory arise in midlife and are related to changes in perceptual recollection and changes in fronto-parietal retrieval monitoring."

First the tensor scale algorithm is applied to extract local structure thickness, orientation, and anisotropy as represented by the largest ellipse within a homogeneous region centered at each image pixel. In this work, we extend the local orientation to 360\u00b0. Then, for the first proposed descriptor, named Tensor Scale Sector descriptor (TSS), the local distributions of relative orientations within circular sectors are used to compose a fixed-length feature vector for a region-based representation. For the second method, named Tensor Scale Band descriptor (TSB), we consider histograms of relative orientations for each circular concentric band to compose a fixed-length feature vector with linear time matching. Experimental results with MPEG-7 and MNIST datasets are presented to illustrate and validate the methods. TSS can achieve high retrieval values comparable to state-of-the-art methods, which usually rely on time-consuming correspondence optimization algorithms, but uses a simpler and faster distance function, while the even faster linear complexity of TSB leads to a suitable and better solution for very large shape collections."

The current study focused on one simple yet rarely examined question: would repeated retrieval using two different retrieval routes or using the same retrieval route twice lead to greater long-term memory retention? Participants elaborately learned 22 Japanese-Chinese translation word pairs using two different mediators. Half an hour after the initial study phase, the participants completed two retrieval sessions using either one mediator (Tm1Tm1) or two different mediators (Tm1Tm2). On the final test, which was performed 1 week after the retrieval practice phase, the participants received only the cue with a request to report the mediator (M1 or M2) followed by the target (Experiment 1) or only the mediator (M1 or M2) with a request to report the target (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 1 indicated that the participants who practiced under the Tm1Tm2 condition exhibited greater target retention than those who practiced under the Tm1Tm1 condition. This difference in performance was due to the significant disadvantage in mediator retrieval and decoding of the unpracticed mediator under the Tm1Tm1 condition. Although mediators were provided to participants on the final test in Experiment 2, decoding of the unpracticed mediators remained less effective than decoding of the practiced mediators. We conclude that practicing multiple retrieval routes leads to greater memory retention than focusing on a single retrieval route. Thus, increasing retrieval variability during repeated retrieval practice indeed significantly improves long-term retention in a delay test."

However, there are a number of challenges regarding the robustness of the image representations and the efficiency of the retrieval framework. To tackle these challenges, we first propose an encoding technique based on soft-assignment of local features to convert an entire image into a single vector, which is a compact and discriminative representation. This encoded vector is suitable for most types of efficient indexing methods to produce an initial result. To compensate for the lack of incorporating geometric and object-related information during the encoding scheme, we then propose a probabilistic topic model to formalize the spatial structure among the local features. Moreover, the topic model allows us to effectively extract the object and background regions from the image. This is performed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for approximate inference. Finally, benefiting from the extracted objects in each image, we present a re-ranking scheme to automatically refine the initial search results. Our proposed retrieval framework has two major advantages: i) an aggregation strategy through soft-assignment improves the discriminative power of the representation, which has a determinative effect on the retrieval precision; and ii) the probabilistic latent topic model enables us to not only gain insight into the spatial structure of the image, but also handle a large variation in the object appearance. The experimental results from four benchmark datasets show that our approach provides competitive accuracy, and runs about ten times faster. Our studies also verify that proposed approach works effectively on large-scale databases of millions of images."

While the Correlation Graph adjacency provides a precise but strict similarity relationship, the Strongly Connected Components analysis expands these relationships considering the dataset geometry. A large and rigorous experimental evaluation protocol was conducted for different image retrieval tasks. The experiments were conducted in different datasets involving various image descriptors. Results demonstrate that the manifold learning algorithm can significantly improve the effectiveness of image retrieval systems.

Solving the ambiguity in image retrieval by combining text features and visual information has been a challenging problem.

CR is used as a plug-in to commercial image search engines, such as Google and Bing, which are defined as host image search engines (HISE). First, in the returned result from HISE, document analysis is utilized to construct the image categories based on the Wikipedia categorical index. Returned images will be automatically categorized, and a convenient interface is provided for user feedback. Second, we describe the re-retrieval algorithm in which image data combined with particular text information will be sent to the HISE for re-retrieval. Finally, a perceptual hash based re-rank algorithm to optimize the returned images is proposed. Experimental results indicate that CR can significantly improve the retrieval performance with minimum effort and can provide a notably convenient user experience."

With an encrypted query image, although the server learns nothing about the plaintext content, it may extract local statistical feature of intra-block AC coefficients using a new feature descriptor. Subsequently, exploiting block-wise feature comparison, the server can measure the similarity between encrypted query image and database image.

In particular, food intake monitoring is becoming more and more important because of the key role that it plays in health and market economies. In this paper, we address the study of food image processing from the perspective of Computer Vision. As first contribution we present a survey of the studies in the context of food image processing from the early attempts to the current state-of-the-art methods. Since retrieval and classification engines able to work on food images are required to build automatic systems for diet monitoring (e.g., to be embedded in wearable cameras), we focus our attention on the aspect of the representation of the food images because it plays a fundamental role in the understanding engines. The food retrieval and classification is a challenging task since the food presents high variableness and an intrinsic deformability. To properly study the peculiarities of different image representations we propose the UNICT-FD1200 dataset. It was composed of 4754 food images of 1200 distinct dishes acquired during real meals. Each food plate is acquired multiple times and the overall dataset presents both geometric and photometric variabilities. The images of the dataset have been manually labeled considering 8 categories: Appetizer, Main Course, Second Course, Single Course, Side Dish, Dessert, Breakfast, Fruit. We have performed tests employing different representations of the state-of-the-art to assess the related performances on the UNICT-FD1200 dataset. Finally, we propose a new representation based on the perceptual concept of Anti-Textons which is able to encode spatial information between Textons outperforming other representations in the context of food retrieval and Classification."

By developing a novel MRI-assisted procedure that reliably localizes recorded single neurons at resolution of six individual layers in monkey temporal cortex, we show that transformation of representations from a cued object to a to-be-recalled object occurs at the infragranular layer in a visual cued-recall task. This cue-to-target conversion started in layer 5 and was followed by layer 6. Finally, a subset of layer 6 neurons exclusively encoding the sought target became phase-locked to surrounding field potentials at theta frequency, suggesting that this coordinated cell assembly implements cortical long-distance outputs of the recalled target. Thus, this study proposes a link from local computation spanning laminar modules of the temporal cortex to the brain-wide network for memory retrieval in primates."

These image signatures, however, are either computationally expensive or simplified for the purpose of trading accuracy for efficiency. To simultaneously guarantee efficiency and effectiveness, we propose a novel image signature termed Soft and Equalized Residual VEctors (SERVE) which is more discriminatively formulated and maintains higher accuracy. It improves VLAD by encoding the variability in within-cluster feature points into the summation of Residual Vectors (RV) while manifesting superiority in computational efficiency over FV. To find the latent low-dimensional manifolds underlying in the SERVE feature space, we propose to partition the original feature space into separate subspaces by random projections and employ multi-graph embedding to obtain additional performance gain.

The semantic differential was partially bridged by proliferation of research on interest point detectors and descriptors, which represented mid-level features of the content. The computational time and human interaction involved in the classical approaches for CBVR are quite cumbersome. In order to increase the accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of the retrieval process, researchers resorted to soft computing paradigms. The entire retrieval task was automated to a great extent using individual soft computing components. Due to voluminous growth in the size of multimedia databases, augmented by an exponential rise in the number of users, integration of two or more soft computing techniques was desirable for enhanced efficiency and accuracy of the retrieval process. The hybrid approaches serve to enhance the overall performance and robustness of the system with reduced human interference. This article is targeted to focus on the relevant hybrid soft computing techniques which are in practice for content-based image and video retrieval."

A carrier signal is a wave form modulated (modified) by an input, deformation of the medium. A carrier is tagged to the medium under analysis and deforms with the medium. The wave form must be known both in the unmodulated and the modulated conditions. There are two basic mathematical models that can be utilized to decode the information contained in the carrier, phase modulation or frequency modulation, both are closely connected. Basic problems connected to the detection and recovery of displacement information that are common to all optical techniques will be analyzed in this paper, focusing on the general theory common to all the methods independently of the type of signal utilized.

We found that the lower the fingerprint patterns activity is, the higher the load ratio and retrieval quality are. A simplified theoretical framework, for the unbiased case, is developed as a function of five parameters: the load ratio, the finiteness connectivity, the density degree of the network, randomness ratio, and the spatial pattern correlation. Linked to the latter appears a new neural dynamics variable: the spatial neural correlation. The theory agrees quite well with the experimental results."

Deep learning has shown to be very effective in variety of visual applications, such as image classification and object detection. However, it has not been successfully applied to 3D shape recognition. This is because 3D shape has complex structure in 3D space and there are limited number of 3D shapes for feature learning. To address these problems, we project 3D shapes into 2D space and use autoencoder for feature learning on the 2D images. High accuracy 3D shape retrieval performance is obtained by aggregating the features learned on 2D images. In addition, we show the proposed deep learning feature is complementary to conventional local image descriptors. By combing the global deep learning representation and the local descriptor representation, our method can obtain the state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape retrieval benchmarks."

Participants underwent fMRI scanning during an associative recognition test that followed a study task performed on visually presented word pairs. Test items comprised pairs of intact (studied pairs), rearranged (items studied on different trials) and new words. fMRI recollection effects were operationalized as greater activity for studied pairs correctly endorsed as intact than for pairs incorrectly endorsed as rearranged. The reverse contrast was employed to identify retrieval monitoring effects. Robust recollection effects were identified in the core recollection network, comprising the hippocampus, along with parahippocampal and posterior cingulate cortex, left angular gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex. Retrieval monitoring effects were identified in the anterior cingulate and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Neither recollection effects within the core network, nor the monitoring effects differed significantly across the age groups after controlling for individual differences in associative recognition performance. Whole brain analyses did however identify three clusters outside of these regions where recollection effects were greater in the young than in the other age groups. Across-participant regression analyses indicated that the magnitude of hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex recollection effects, and both of the prefrontal monitoring effects, correlated significantly with memory performance. None of these correlations were moderated by age. The findings suggest that the relationships between memory performance and functional activity in regions consistently implicated in successful recollection and retrieval monitoring are stable across much of the healthy adult lifespan."

We examined this question using three versions of a modified Semantic Object Retrieval Test, where object memory was probed by a feature presented as a written word, a spoken word, or a picture, followed by a second feature always presented as a visual word. Participants indicated whether each feature pair elicited retrieval of the memory of a particular object. Sixteen subjects completed one of the three versions (N = 48 in total) while their EEG were recorded simultaneously. We analyzed EEG data in four separate frequency bands (delta: 1\u20134 Hz, theta: 4\u20137 Hz; alpha: 8\u201312 Hz; beta: 13\u201319 Hz) using a multivariate data-driven approach. We found that alpha power time-locked to response was modulated by both cross-modality (visual vs. auditory) and cross-domain (verbal vs. nonverbal) probing of semantic object memory. In addition, retrieval trials showed greater changes in all frequency bands compared to non-retrieval trials across all stimulus types in both response-locked and stimulus-locked analyses, suggesting dissociable neural subcomponents involved in binding object features to retrieve a memory. We conclude that these findings support both modality/domain-dependent and modality/domain-independent mechanisms during semantic object memory retrieval."

Rainfall rate derived from the widely used \u201cTipping-Bucket rain gauge\u201d usually neglects its temporal variation especially during the low rainfall intensity periods. This study explores a heuristic artificial neural networks (ANN) approach along with the conventional Cubic Spline Algorithm (CSA) and Multivariate Linear Regression method (MLR) for high temporal resolution rainfall rate retrieval for the period of 2007 to 2009 at Chilbolton, U.K. The Supervised Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm and the K-folds cross-validation method are integrated in a feed-forward neural network as to implicitly detect complex nonlinear relationships and to avoid model overfitting. Results indicate ANN is performing equivalently well with CSA after training, however, with poor generalisation in test due to low correlation between input and target data, as well as the curse of dimensionality in optimum model complexity selection. MLR can be an alternative approach in rainfall rate estimation but it highly depends on the data quality."

In recent years, with an increasing amount of high resolution remote sensing images, it becomes more and more urgent to find a way to retrieve them. In this case, a few methods based on the statistical information of the local features are proposed, which have achieved good performances. However, most of the methods do not take the topological structure of the features into account. In this paper, we propose a new method to represent these images, by taking the structural information into consideration. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) mapping the features into a manifold space by a Lipschitz smooth function to enhance the representation ability of the features; (2) training an anchor set with several regularization constrains to get the intrinsic manifold structure. In the experiments, the method is applied to two challenging remote sensing image datasets: UC Merced land use dataset and Sydney dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve a more robust and commendable performance."

In Experiment 1, participants studied unrelated words associated with low, medium, or high values. Subsequent memory tests required participants to selectively monitor retrieval for different values. False memory effects were smaller when searching memory for high-value than low-value words, suggesting that people more effectively monitored more important information. In Experiment 2, participants studied semantically-related words, and the need for retrieval monitoring was reduced at test by using inclusion instructions (i.e., endorsement of any word related to the studied words) compared with standard instructions. Inclusion instructions led to increases in false recognition for low-value, but not for high-value words, suggesting that under standard-instruction conditions retrieval monitoring was less likely to occur for important information. Experiment 3 showed that words retrieved with lower confidence were associated with more effective retrieval monitoring, suggesting that the quality of the retrieved memory influenced the degree and effectiveness of monitoring processes. Ironically, unless encouraged to do so, people were less likely to carefully monitor important information, even though people want to remember important memories most accurately."

In this paper, by exploiting the uncertainty in ambiguous medical queries, we propose a novel semantic-based approach to achieve the diversity-aware retrieval of EMRs, i.e., both the relevance and novelty are considered for EMR ranking. With the support of medical domain ontologies, we first mine all the potential semantics (concepts and relations between them) from a user query and consume them to model the multiple query aspects. Then, we propose a novel diversification strategy, which considers not only the aspect importance but also the aspect similarity, to perform the diversity-aware EMR ranking. A real-world pilot study, which utilizes the proposed medical search approach to improve the second use of the EMRs, is reported. We believe that our experience can serve as an important reference for the development of similar applications in a medical data utilization and sharing environment."

This fMRI study aimed at clarifying how the format of the retrieval query shapes the neural basis of source recollection. During encoding, participants made semantic (pleasantness) or perceptual (number of letters) judgments about words. Subsequently, in a source memory test, the retrieval query was manipulated such that for half of the items from each encoding task, the retrieval query emphasized the semantic source (i.e., semantic query format: \u201cIs this word from the pleasantness task?\u201d), whereas for the other half the retrieval query emphasized the alternate, perceptual source (i.e., perceptual query format: \u201cIs this word from the letter task?\u201d). The results showed that the semantic query format was associated with higher source recognition than the perceptual query format. This behavioral advantage was accompanied by increased activation in several regions associated to controlled semantic elaboration and monitoring of internally-generated features about the past event. In particular, for items semantically encoded, the semantic query, relative to the perceptual query, induced activation in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampal, parahippocampal and middle temporal cortex. Conversely, for items perceptually encoded, the semantic query recruited the lateral PFC and occipital-fusiform areas. Interestingly, the semantic format also influenced the processing of new items, eliciting greater L lateral and medial PFC activation. In contrast, the perceptual query format (versus the semantic format) only prompted greater activation in R orbitofrontal cortex and the R inferior parietal lobe, for items encoded in a perceptual manner and for new items, respectively. The results highlight the role of the retrieval query format in source remembering, showing that the retrieval query that emphasizes the semantic source promotes the use of semantic strategies via medial and L lateral PFC activations. These frontal activations are accompanied by differential recruitment of more posterior regions, depending on the type of information that had been encoded."

Hence, Recommender Systems (RSs) are used to find the users\u2019 most favorite items. Finding these items relies on items or users similarities. Though, many factors like sparsity and cold start user impress the recommendation quality. In some systems, attached tags are used for searching items (e.g. videos) as personalized recommendation. Different views, incomplete and inaccurate tags etc. can weaken the performance of these systems. Considering the advancement of computer vision techniques can help improving RSs. To this end, content based search can be used for finding items (here, videos are considered). In such systems, a video is taken from the user to find and recommend a list of most similar videos to the query one. Due to relating most videos to humans, we present a novel low complex scalable method to recommend videos based on the model of included action. This method has recourse to human action retrieval approaches. For modeling human actions, some interest points are extracted from each action and their motion information are used to compute the action representation. Moreover, a fuzzy dissimilarity measure is presented to compare videos for ranking them.

        "abstract": "During memory retrieval, consolidated memories are expressed and destabilized in order to maintain or update information through a memory reconsolidation process. Despite the key role of the amygdala during memory acquistion and consolidation, the participation of neurotransmitter signals in memory retrieval is poorly understood. Hence, we used conditioned taste aversion and in vivo microdialysis to evaluate changes in glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations within the amygdala during memory retrieval. We observed that exposure to an aversive-conditioned stimulus induced an augmentation in glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine levels within the amygdala, while exposure to a familiar and safe stimulus did not induce changes in these neurotransmitters levels. Also, we evaluated the amygdalar blockade of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), \u03b2-adrenergic and dopamine D1 receptors in memory retrieval and updating. Results showed that during retrieval, behavioural expression was impaired by intra-amygdalar blockade of AMPA and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, whereas NMDA, D1 and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors blockade hindered memory updating. In summary, during conditioned taste aversion retrieval there was an increase in the extracellular levels of glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine within the amygdala, and their receptors activity were differentially involved in the behavioural expression and memory updating during retrieval."

        "abstract": "In the hashing approaches with multi-bit quantization, each projected dimension is divided into multiple regions indexed with multiple bits to preserve the neighborhood structure of the data. However, the query is processed in binary, and the distances between the adjacent regions are usually assumed to be equal, resulting in the accuracy loss of the computed distance between the data and the query. To tackle the above problems, in this paper an approach is proposed to process the query and the data asymmetrically. By representing the data with the expectation value of the region where the data belong and preserving the query in original form, the distance between the query and the data can be computed accurately. A specific asymmetric approach with non-parametric multi-bit quantization is further developed for the PCA (Principle Component Analysis) hashing method. With the special consideration of PCA characteristic, every projected dimension is adaptively divided into a certain number of the regions according to the minimal variance. The results of the experiments have shown that the better performance can be obtained in the asymmetric hashing approach with multi-bit quantization than that in the other approaches, and can be improved further in the specific asymmetric approach with non-parametric multi-bit quantization with respect to the PCA hashing method."

Most state-of-the-art shape retrieval methods are based on local features matching and ranking.

In the first irrelevant cluster filtering (ICF) stage, we consider both global and local features and use them to predict the relevance of gallery shapes with respect to the query. Irrelevant shapes are removed from the candidate shape set. After that, a local-features-based matching and ranking (LMR) method follows in the second stage. We apply the proposed TSR system to MPEG-7, Kimia99 and Tari1000 three datasets and show that it outperforms all other existing methods. The robust retrieval performance of the TSR system is demonstrated."

For a given image, its statistical image model is automatically learned by using a finite mixture model to approximate the distribution of its image pixels in the 10-dimensional feature space. Such statistical image modeling process can also achieve automatic image segmentation implicitly. To achieve more precise matching between the mixture components and the local distributions of the relevant image pixels, an adaptive EM algorithm is developed to simultaneously select the model structure (i.e., the optimal number of mixture components) and estimate the model parameters (i.e., locations and statistical properties of the mixture components) according to the local distributions of the relevant image pixels. For a given image concept or object class of interest, its statistical concept model is automatically learned from the statistical image models for the labeled training images. Finally, similarity matching for automatic detection of object classes and image concepts is treated as a partial model matching problem, i.e., matching between the statistical image model for a given test image and all the statistical concept models for the object classes and image concepts of interest. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our statistical modeling algorithm can achieve very competitive results on both automatic image segmentation and classification."

The work proposed in this paper introduces a framework to enable reusability of manufacturing knowledge through inference rules applied on manufacturing ontologies. Initially, a mechanism is used to access a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and through a rule-based approach, it exports the analogous ontological schema. The ontology constitutes the knowledge base and is stored in a knowledge repository. An inference engine is then used to query this repository and derive additional assertions, which are entailed from the base schema, on product, process, and resource. The method is developed in a web app, which offers to the users the capability to create, activate, and share rules and results on engineering topics. The effectiveness of the framework is validated using a real industrial case from a high-precision mould-making SME."

The comparisons between satellite-derived precipitation estimates and validation data show that the developed scheme performs reasonably well. Indeed, the correlation coefficient presents a significant level (r:0.87). The values of POD, POFD and FAR are 80%, 13% and 25%, respectively.

Image enhancement is achieved via lateral inhibition. Fundamental issues in this topic are investigated in this paper: (1) whether it is sensible to adopt an evolutionary algorithm to search for the best-match result, given that the concerned optimization problem has merely two dimensions; (2) how lateral inhibition takes effect to facilitate image retrieval. According to our comparative experimental results, there is no evidence that indicates lateral inhibition makes any subtle effort to ease the best-match optimization process.

While there is some empirical support for this view, a notable exception is the absence of evidence for the flexible use of retrieval control in functional neuroimaging experiments requiring frequent switches between tasks with different cognitive demands. This absence is troublesome in so far as frequent switches between tasks mimic some of the challenges that are typically placed on memory outside the laboratory. In this experiment we instructed participants to alternate frequently between three episodic memory tasks requiring item recognition or retrieval of one of two different kinds of contextual information encoded in a prior study phase (screen location or encoding task). Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by unstudied items in the two tasks requiring retrieval of study context were reliably different, demonstrating for the first time that ERPs index task-specific processing of retrieval cues when retrieval goals change frequently. The inclusion of the item recognition task was a novel and important addition in this study, because only the ERPs elicited by unstudied items in one of the two context conditions diverged from those in the item recognition condition. This outcome constrains functional interpretations of the differences that emerged between the two context conditions and emphasises the utility of this baseline in functional imaging studies of retrieval processing operations."

The main idea is to use these features to select the best expansion terms in a machine learning-based query expansion approach.

We use the features both to summarize the spatial characteristics of the spatial distribution of a single term, and to determine the similarity between the spatial profiles of two terms \u2013 i.e., term-to-term spatial similarity. To further improve our approach, we investigate the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal features on choosing the expansion terms.

This helps in handling the existing variability or heterogeneity within this semantic. Adaptive combinations of the obtained depictions are utilized by the branch selection and pruning algorithms to identify some closer semantics and select only a part of the large hierarchical search space for actual search. So obtained search space is finally used to retrieve desired semantics and similar images corresponding to them. The system is evaluated in terms of accuracy of the retrieved semantics and precision-recall curves. Experiments show promising semantics and image retrieval results on hierarchical image databases.

Past studies identified asteroids which could be efficiently injected into manifolds which wind onto periodic orbits around collinear Lagrangian points of the Sun-Earth system. However, the trajectories are unstable, and errors in the capture maneuver would lead to complete mission failure, with potential danger of collision with the Earth, if uncontrolled. This paper investigates the controllability of some asteroids along the transfers and the periodic orbits, assuming the use of a solar-electric low-thrust system shepherding the asteroid. Firstly, an analytical approach is introduced to estimate the stability of the trajectories from a dynamical point of view; then, a numerical control scheme based on a linear quadratic regulator is proposed, where the gains are optimized for each trajectory through a genetic algorithm. A stochastic simulation with a Monte Carlo approach is used to account for different perturbed initial conditions and the epistemic uncertainty on the asteroid mass. Results show that only a small subset of the considered combinations of trajectories/asteroids are reliably controllable, and therefore controllability must be taken into account in the selection of potential targets."

The support vector machine (SVM) based RF mechanisms have been used in different fields of image retrieval, but they often treat all positive and negative feedback samples equally, which will inevitably degrade the effectiveness of SVM-based RF approaches for CBIR. In fact, positive and negative feedback samples, different positive feedback samples, and different negative feedback samples all always have distinct properties. Moreover, each feedback interaction process is usually tedious and time-consuming because of complex visual features, so if too many times of iteration of feedback are asked, users may be impatient to interact with the CBIR system. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a new SVM-based RF approach using probabilistic feature and weighted kernel function in this paper. Firstly, the probabilistic features of each image are extracted by using principal components analysis (PCA) and the adapted Gaussian mixture models (AGMM) based dimension reduction, and the similarity is computed by employing Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence. Secondly, the positive feedback samples and negative feedback samples are marked, and all feedback samples\u2019 weight values are computed by utilizing the samples-based Relief feature weighting. Finally, the SVM kernel function is modified dynamically according to the feedback samples\u2019 weight values. Extensive simulations on large databases show that the proposed algorithm is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches."

The spontaneous object recognition test consisted of three phases. In the sample phase, rats were exposed to two identical objects several (2\u20135) times in the arena. After the sample phase, various lengths of delay intervals (24 h-6 weeks) were inserted (delay phase). In the test phase in which both the familiar and the novel objects were placed in the arena, rats\u2019 novel object exploration behavior under the hippocampal treatment of NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5, or vehicle was observed. With 5 exposure sessions in the sample phase (experiment 1), AP5 treatment in the test phase significantly decreased discrimination ratio when the delay was 3 weeks but not when it was one week. On the other hand, with 2 exposure sessions in the sample phase (experiment 2) in which even vehicle-injected control animals could not discriminate the novel object from the familiar one with a 3 week delay, AP5 treatment significantly decreased discrimination ratio when the delay was one week, but not when it was 24 h. Additional experiment (experiment 3) showed that the hippocampal treatment of an \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, NBQX, decreased discrimination ratio with all delay intervals tested (24 h-3 weeks). Results suggest that hippocampal NMDA receptors play an important role in the retrieval of spontaneous object recognition memory especially when the memory trace weakens."

        "abstract": "The rapid development of 3D digital technology has led to an increasing volume of 3D model data. In addressing the management of such large scale data, effective content-based 3D model retrieval and recognition methods are highly desirable. In 3D model retrieval and recognition tasks, the distance measure between two 3D models plays an important role. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D model retrieval and recognition method that employs both a distance histogram and 3D moment invariants as features that are invariant to 3D object scaling, translation, and rotation. Disjoint information is used to measure the distance between the feature histograms, and the Euclidean distance is applied in calculating the distance between two moment features. These measures are then combined as the 3D model distance. Using this distance measure, the relationships between all 3D models in the dataset are formulated as a graph structure. A semi-supervised learning process is then conducted to estimate the relevance among the 3D models, and this is employed for 3D model retrieval and classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two datasets. Experimental results and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved performance for 3D model retrieval and recognition tasks."

In this paper, we compare the organisation and retrieval of architectural knowledge in a file-based documentation approach and an ontology-based documentation approach. The ontology-based approach offers a multi-dimensional organisation of architectural knowledge by means of a software ontology and semantic wiki, whereas file-based documentation typically uses hierarchical organisation by directory structure and table of content. We conducted case studies in two companies to study the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieving architectural knowledge from the different organisations of knowledge.

Next, they described their memory for each event and rated its phenomenological characteristics. Over the following three weeks, they repeatedly retrieved half of the mini-event and cue-word memories. No instructions were given about how to retrieve the memories. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to adopt either a first- or third-person perspective during retrieval. One month later, participants retrieved all of the memories and again provided phenomenology ratings.

The amount of this content being captured and the difficulties of manually searching audio data mean that efficient automated search tools are of increasing importance if its full potential is to be realized. Much existing work on speech search has focused on retrieval of clearly defined document units in ad hoc search tasks. We investigate search of informal speech content using an extended version of the AMI meeting collection. A retrieval collection was constructed by augmenting the AMI corpus with a set of ad hoc search requests and manually identified relevant regions of the recorded meetings. Unlike standard ad hoc information retrieval focussing primarily on precision, we assume a recall-focused search scenario of a user seeking to retrieve a particular incident occurring within meetings relevant to the query. We explore the relationship between automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy, automated segmentation of the meeting into retrieval units and retrieval behaviour with respect to both precision and recall. Experimental retrieval results show that while averaged retrieval effectiveness is generally comparable in terms of precision for automatically extracted segments for manual content transcripts and ASR transcripts with high recognition accuracy, segments with poor recognition quality become very hard to retrieve and may fall below the retrieval rank position to which a user is willing search. These changes impact on system effectiveness for recall-focused search tasks. Varied ASR quality across the relevant and non-relevant data means that the rank of some well-recognized relevant segments is actually promoted for ASR transcripts compared to manual ones. This effect is not revealed by the averaged precision based retrieval evaluation metrics typically used for evaluation of speech retrieval. However such variations in the ranks of relevant segments can impact considerably on the experience of the user in terms of the order in which retrieved content is presented. Analysis of our results reveals that while relevant longer segments are generally more robust to ASR errors, and consequentially retrieved at higher ranks, this is often at the expense of the user needing to engage in longer content playback to locate the relevant content in the audio recording. Our overall conclusion being that it is desirable to minimize the length of retrieval units containing relevant content while seeking to maintain high ranking of these items."

The proposed approach directly derives an image descriptor from the Ordered Dither Block Truncation Coding (ODBTC) data stream without performing the decoding process. The Color Histogram Feature (CHF) is generated from the two ODBTC color quantizer, while the Halftoning Local Derivative Pattern (HLDP) is constructed from the ODBTC bitmap image. The similarity between two images are measured from their CHF and HLDP features. Three schemes are involved to improve the image retrieval accuracy, including the similarity weight optimization, feature reweighting, and user relevance feedback optimization. An evolutionary stochastic algorithm is exploited to optimize the similarity weight and feature weight in the nearest neighbor distance computation, as well as in the query update of relevance feedback optimization. Section 5 shows that the proposed scheme yields a promising result, and thus it can be a very effective candidate in addressing the content-based image retrieval and image classification task."

In everyday situations, however, there are multiple event features competing for our attention. It is not currently known how selectively attending to one contextual feature while attempting to ignore another influences context memory performance and the processes that support successful retrieval in the young and old. We investigated this issue in the current ERP study. Young and older participants studied pictures of objects in the presence of two contextual features: a color and a scene, and their attention was directed to the object's relationship with one of those contexts. Participants made context memory decisions for both attended and unattended contexts and rated their confidence in those decisions. Behavioral results showed that while both groups were generally successful in applying selective attention during context encoding, older adults were less confident in their context memory decisions for attended features and showed greater dependence in context memory accuracy for attended and unattended contextual features (i.e., hyper-binding). ERP results were largely consistent between age groups but older adults showed a more pronounced late posterior negativity (LPN) implicated in episodic reconstruction processes. We conclude that age-related suppression deficits during encoding result in reduced selectivity in context memory, thereby increasing subsequent demands on episodic reconstruction processes when sought after details are not readily retrieved."

Recent findings suggest that stress might also impair the retrieval of non-hippocampal memories. In particular, stress shortly before retention testing was shown to impair the retrieval of striatal stimulus-response associations in humans. However, the mechanism underlying this stress-induced retrieval impairment of non-hippocampal stimulus-response memory remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated whether an acute elevation in glucocorticoid levels mediates the impairing effects of stress on retrieval of stimulus-response memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a stimulus-response task in an eight-arm radial maze until they learned to associate a stimulus, i.e., cue, with a food reward in one of the arms. Twenty-four hours after successful acquisition, they received a systemic injection of vehicle, corticosterone (1 mg/kg), the corticosterone-synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (35 mg/kg) or were left untreated 1 h before retention testing. We found that the corticosterone injection impaired the retrieval of stimulus-response memory. We further found that the systemic injection procedure per se was stressful as the vehicle administration also increased plasma corticosterone levels and impaired the retrieval of stimulus-response memory. However, memory retrieval was not impaired when rats were tested 2 min after the systemic vehicle injection, before any stress-induced elevation in corticosterone levels had occurred. Moreover, metyrapone treatment blocked the effect of injection stress on both plasma corticosterone levels and memory retrieval impairment, indicating that the endogenous corticosterone response mediates the stress-induced memory retrieval impairment. None of the treatments affected rats\u2019 locomotor activity or motivation to search for the food reward within the maze. These findings show that stress may affect memory processes beyond the hippocampus and that these stress effects are due to the action of glucocorticoids."

Recently, hashing method mapping the high-dimensional data to compact binary codes has attracted a lot of concerns due to its efficiency and low storage cost over large-scale dataset. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Consistency Hashing (SCH) method for cross-modal retrieval. SCH learns a shared semantic space simultaneously taking both inter-modal and intra-modal semantic correlations into account. In order to preserve the inter-modal semantic consistency, an identical representation is learned using non-negative matrix factorization for the samples with different modalities. Meanwhile, neighbor preserving algorithm is adopted to preserve the semantic consistency in each modality. In addition, an effective optimal algorithm is proposed to reduce the time complexity from traditional O ( N 2 ) or higher to O(N). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing schemes."

Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval."

A novel retrieval methodology for such data is introduced in this paper. The proposed methodology automatically detects specific facial landmarks and uses them to create a descriptor. This descriptor is the concatenation of three sub-descriptors which capture topological as well as geometric information of the 3D face scans. The motivation behind the proposed hybrid facial expression descriptor is the fact that some facial expressions, like happiness and surprise, are characterized by obvious changes in the mouth topology while others, like anger, fear and sadness, produce geometric but no significant topological changes. The proposed retrieval scheme exploits the Dynamic Time Warping technique in order to compare descriptors corresponding to different 3D facial sequences. A detailed evaluation of the introduced retrieval scheme is presented showing that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. Experiments have been conducted using the six prototypical expressions of the standard dataset BU-4DFE and the eight prototypical expressions of the recently available dataset BP4D-Spontaneous. Finally, a majority voting scheme based on the retrieval results is used to achieve unsupervised dynamic 3D facial expression recognition. The achieved classification accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised dynamic 3D facial expression recognition techniques."

The need for pattern-based analysis arises when images/rasters contain rich spatial information either because of their very high resolution or their very large spatial extent. Elementary units of pattern-based analysis are scenes \u2013 patches of surface consisting of a complex arrangement of individual pixels (patterns). GeoPAT modules implement popular GIS algorithms, such as query, overlay, and segmentation, to operate on the grid of scenes. To achieve these capabilities GeoPAT includes a library of scene signatures \u2013 compact numerical descriptors of patterns, and a library of distance functions \u2013 providing numerical means of assessing dissimilarity between scenes. Ancillary GeoPAT modules use these functions to construct a grid of scenes or to assign signatures to individual scenes having regular or irregular geometries. Thus GeoPAT combines knowledge retrieval from patterns with mapping tasks within a single integrated GIS environment. GeoPAT is designed to identify and analyze complex, highly generalized classes in spatial datasets. Examples include distinguishing between different styles of urban settlements using VHR images, delineating different landscape types in land cover maps, and mapping physiographic units from DEM. The concept of pattern-based spatial analysis is explained and the roles of all modules and functions are described. A case study example pertaining to delineation of landscape types in a subregion of NLCD is given. Performance evaluation is included to highlight GeoPAT's applicability to very large datasets.

With the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, the precise timing of such reactivation is unclear, calling into question the functional significance of these effects. Whereas reactivation influencing retrieval should emerge with neural correlates of retrieval success, that signifying post-retrieval monitoring would trail retrieval. The present study employed EEG to provide a temporal landmark of retrieval success from which we could investigate the sub-trial time course of reactivation. Pattern-classification analyses revealed that early-onsetting reactivation differentiated the outcome of recognition-memory judgments and was associated with individual differences in behavioral accuracy, while reactivation was also evident in a sustained form later in the trial.

To represent the invariant object features, including local shape details and global body parts, a novel multi-scale invariant descriptor is proposed. Different types of invariant features are represented in multiple scales, which makes the following metric learning algorithm effective. To reduce the effect of noise and improve the computing efficiency, an adaptive discrete contour evolution method is also proposed to extract the salient feature points of object. The recognition algorithm is explored based on metric learning method and the object features are summarized as histograms inspired from the Bag of Words (BoW). The metric learning methods are employed to learn object features according to their scales. The proposed method is invariant to rotation, scale variation, intra-class variation, articulated deformation and partial occlusion. The recognition process is fast and robust for noise. This method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets and the comparable experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our method."

Medical community needs to extract precise information from that large amount of data. Currently ICT approaches do not provide a methodology for content-based medical images retrieval and classification. On the other hand, from the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective, the ICT medical data can be produced by several devices. Produced data complies with all Big Data features and constraints. The IoT guidelines put at the center of the system a new smart software to manage and transform Big Data in a new understanding form. This paper describes a text based indexing system for mammographic images retrieval and classification. The system deals with text (structured reports) and images (mammograms) mining and classification in a typical Department of Radiology. DICOM structured reports, containing free text for medical diagnosis, have been analyzed and labeled in order to classify the corresponding mammographic images. Information Retrieval process is based on some text manipulation techniques, such as light semantic analysis, stop-word removing, and light medical natural language processing. The system includes also a Search Engine module, based on a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of Specificity and Sensibility. Two more indexes have been computed in order to assess the system robustness: the A z (Area under ROC Curve) index and the \u03c3 A z ( A z standard error) index. The dataset is composed of healthy and pathological DICOM structured reports. Two use case scenarios are presented and described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Point pairs that are close in this vector space are frequently similar, not only in terms of the dialog activities, but also in topic. Using proximity in this space as an indicator of similarity, we built support for a query-by-example function. Searchers were happy to use this function, and it provided value on a large testset.

For surface features at normal temperature in SWIR band, emission energy can be ignored. While for surface features at high temperature in SWIR band, emission energy is equal to or even higher than the reflection energy. So remote sensing imagery of SWIR band can be used to separate emission and reflection energy as well as to realize temperature retrieval of high temperature targets. In this study, the seventh band (SWIR band) of Landsat8 OLI remote sensing imagery is used to perform the theoretical model research for temperature retrieval of high temperature targets. In the meantime, it is also used with the corresponding observation experiment of synchronization satellite to check the theoretical model. The result shows that the radiant flux density for mixed pixels with high temperature targets is higher than adjacent pixels without high temperature targets. Thus, the high temperature pixels can be identified in SWIR band. The retrieval results of temperature and fractional area for high temperature targets are consistent with reality. In the study, the result illustrates that it is effective to identify high temperature targets in remote sensing imagery of SWIR band and the model is appropriate for temperature retrieval use."

We examine the moderating effects of what is arguably the most fundamental distinction to be made about retrieval: whether a retrieval attempt results in success or failure. After reviewing research on this topic, we conclude that retrieval practice is beneficial even when the retrieval attempt is unsuccessful. This finding appears to hold true in a variety of laboratory and real-world contexts and applies to learners across the lifespan. Based on these findings we outline a two-stage model in which learning from retrieval involves (1) a retrieval attempt and then (2) processing the answer. We then turn to a second issue: Does retrieval success even matter for learning? Recent findings suggest that retrieval failure followed by feedback leads to the same amount of learning as retrieval success. In light of these findings, we propose that separate mechanisms are not needed to explain the effect of retrieval success and retrieval failure on learning. We then review existing theories of retrieval and comment on their compatibility with extant data, and end with theoretical conclusions for researchers as well as practical advice for learners and teachers."

A codebook is organized in a hierarchical vocabulary tree, which maintains structural information of visual words and enables efficient retrieval in sub-linear time. Experimental results on three data sets demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithm for effective and efficient sketch retrieval."

        "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter associated with the land-atmosphere interface. Satellite remote sensing is the most effective method of measuring LST at regional and global scales. Satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements are widely used to retrieve LST with high accuracy and high spatial resolution but are limited to cloud-free conditions due to their inability to penetrate clouds. By contrast, satellite passive microwave (PMW) measurements are capable of penetrating clouds and providing data regardless of the cloud conditions. However, PMW measurements have limitations, such as a low spatial resolution and low temperature retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, temperature retrieval from PMW measurements yields the subsurface temperature, which differs from the LST retrieved from TIR measurements (skin temperature). This study proposes a framework for the retrieval of all-weather LST at a high spatial resolution by combining the advantages of TIR and PMW measurements. Compared to the MODIS LST product, the all-weather LST reflects the spatial variations in LST accurately. In situ LST measurements at four sites in an arid area of northwest China were used to evaluate the accuracy of the all-weather LST. The root mean square error of the LST under cloud-free conditions was approximately 2 K, whereas that of the LST under cloudy conditions varied from 3.5 K to 4.4 K. The results indicate that the all-weather LST retrieval algorithm can provide an LST dataset with reasonable accuracy and a high spatial resolution under clear and cloudy conditions."

Medium spatial resolution (\u2265250 m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (\u226430 m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5 m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability."

        "abstract": "Human motion retrieval plays an important role in many motion data based applications. In the past, many researchers tended to use a single type of visual feature as data representation. Because different visual feature describes different aspects about motion data, and they have dissimilar discriminative power with respect to one particular class of human motion, it led to poor retrieval performance. Thus, it would be beneficial to combine multiple visual features together for motion data representation. In this article, we present an Adaptive Multi-view Feature Selection (AMFS) method for human motion retrieval. Specifically, we first use a local linear regression model to automatically learn multiple view-based Laplacian graphs for preserving the local geometric structure of motion data. Then, these graphs are combined together with a non-negative view-weight vector to exploit the complementary information between different features. Finally, in order to discard the redundant and irrelevant feature components from the original high-dimensional feature representation, we formulate the objective function of AMFS as a general trace ratio optimization problem, and design an effective algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experiments on two public human motion database, i.e., HDM05 and MSR Action3D, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AMFS over the state-of-art methods for motion data retrieval. The scalability with large motion dataset, and insensitivity with the algorithm parameters, make our method can be widely used in real-world applications."

Annotation also has important applications in the automatic generation of structured radiology reports. Much of the prior research work has focused on annotating images with properties such as the modality of the image, or the biological system or body region being imaged. However, many challenges remain for the annotation of high-level semantic content in medical images (e.g., presence of calcification, vessel obstruction, etc.) due to the difficulty in discovering relationships and associations between low-level image features and high-level semantic concepts. This difficulty is further compounded by the lack of labelled training data. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic semantic annotation of medical images that leverages techniques from content-based image retrieval (CBIR). CBIR is a well-established image search technology that uses quantifiable low-level image features to represent the high-level semantic content depicted in those images. Our method extends CBIR techniques to identify or retrieve a collection of labelled images that have similar low-level features and then uses this collection to determine the best high-level semantic annotations. We demonstrate our annotation method using retrieval via weighted nearest-neighbour retrieval and multi-class classification to show that our approach is viable regardless of the underlying retrieval strategy. We experimentally compared our method with several well-established baseline techniques (classification and regression) and showed that our method achieved the highest accuracy in the annotation of liver computed tomography (CT) images."

The I1QCb color space, whose component of images having matching characteristics, increases the distinctive power for retrieval system.

The objective is to identify the information provided by each sensor and to analyze preprocessing methods \u2013 such as the day/night average, diurnal difference and microwave polarization difference index for AMSR-E and the incidence angle normalization and backscatter temporal index for ASCAT \u2013 to maximize the amount of soil moisture information extracted. Additionally, the data fusion and a posteriori synergy methodologies are compared to determine how to optimally exploit this combined information. This study is performed using a neural network (NN) to estimate soil moisture from a set of AMSR-E and ASCAT observations. ERA-interim/Land surface soil moisture fields are used to train the NN as well as to evaluate the performance of the different retrieval input datasets. It is shown that using the AMSR-E 7 GHz, 11 GHz, 19 GHz and 37 GHz channels with the three preprocessing methods highlights various surface contributions in the signal, in particular the soil moisture and surface temperature information, and greatly helps the retrieval in disentangling them. For ASCAT, the synergy effect is less significant and data preprocessed with the two methods analyzed yields very similar information. The information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors is found to be very complementary, such that a soil moisture retrieval using the combined active and passive information shows a significant improvement between 5% and 19% in the temporal correlation and a reduction of the retrieval uncertainty by 7%. The improvement in the spatial structure is smaller with a correlation increase of 2%. It is demonstrated that the choice of synergy method strongly impacts the retrieval improvement that can be achieved. Data fusion methods are shown to be better suited than a posteriori combination methods, due to their ability to exploit information complementarity. These results could help improve future active/passive soil moisture retrievals, such as from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission, through the application of similar preprocessing and synergy methods in order to better extract the soil moisture information provided."

Image clickthrough data have been successfully used to build concept detectors without any manual annotation effort, although the generated annotations suffer from labeling errors. Previous research efforts therefore focused on modeling the sample uncertainty in order to improve concept detector effectiveness. In this paper, we study the problem in an online learning setting using streaming clickthrough data where each click is treated seperately when it becomes available; the concept detector model is therefore continuously updated without batch retraining. We argue that sample uncertainty can be incorporated in the online learning setting by exploiting the repetitions of incoming clicks at the classifier level, where these act as an implicit importance weighting mechanism. For online concept detector training we use the LASVM algorithm. The inferred weighting approximates the solution of batch trained concept detectors using weighted SVM variants that are known to achieve improved performance and high robustness to noise compared to the standard SVM. Furthermore, we evaluate methods for selecting negative samples using a small number of candidates sampled locally from the incoming stream of clicks. The selection criteria aim at drastically improving the performance and the convergence speed of the online concept detectors. To validate our arguments we conduct experiments for 30 concepts on the Clickture-Lite dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that: (a) the proposed online approach produces effective and noise resilient concept detectors that can take advantage of streaming clickthrough data and achieve performance that is equivalent to Fuzzy SVM concept detectors with sample weights and 78.6% improved compared to standard SVM concept detectors; and (b) the selection criteria speed up convergence and improve effectiveness compared to random negative sampling even for a small number of available clicks (up to 134% after 100 clicks)."

The proposed method collects the texton XOR pattern which gives the structure of the query image or database image. First, the RGB (red, green, blue) color image is converted into HSV (hue, saturation and value) color space. Second, the V color space is divided into overlapping subblocks of size 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 and textons are collected based on the shape of the textons. Then, exclusive OR (XOR) operation is performed on the texton image between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors. Finally, the feature vector is constructed based on the LTxXORPs and HSV histograms. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by testing on benchmark database, Corel-1K, Corel-5K and Corel-10K in terms of precision, recall, average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR). The results after investigation show a significant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art features for image retrieval."

However, due to the inadequately described service information, users often feel confused while trying to find the optimal services. Although some approaches are proposed to deal with cloud service retrieval and recommendation issues, they would only work for certain restricted scenarios in dealing with basic service specifications. Indeed, the missing extent is that most of the cloud services are \u201cagile\u201d whilst there are many vague service terms and descriptions. This paper proposes an agility-oriented and fuzziness-embedded cloud service ontology model, which adopts agility-centric design along with OWL2 (Web Ontology Language) fuzzy extensions. The captured cloud service specifications are maintained in an open and collaborative manner, as the fuzziness in the model accepts rating updates from users on the fly. The model enables comprehensive service specification by capturing cloud concept details and their interactions, even across multiple service categories and abstraction levels. Utilizing the model as a knowledge base, a service recommendation system prototype is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the approach can outperform existing practices by achieving effective service search, retrieval and recommendation outcomes."

This effect has been explained by the fact that more memories are directly retrieved from object versus emotion cues. In the present study, we tested whether RT differences between memories cued by emotion versus object terms occur not only because object cues elicit direct retrieval of more memories (Uzer, Lee, &amp; Brown, 2012), but also because of differences in memory generation in response to emotions versus objects. One hundred university students retrieved memories in response to basic-level (e.g. orange), superordinate-level (e.g. plant), and emotion (e.g. surprised) cues. Retrieval speed was measured and participants reported whether memories were directly retrieved or generated on each trial. Results showed that memories were retrieved faster in response to basic-level versus superordinate-level and emotion cues because a) basic-level cues elicited more directly retrieved memories, and b) generating memories was more difficult when cues were abstract versus concrete. These results suggest that generative retrieval is a cue generation process in which additional cues that provide contextual information including the target event are produced. Memories are retrieved more slowly in response to emotion cues in part because emotion labels are less effective cues of appropriate contextual information. This particular finding is inconsistent with the idea that emotion is a primary organizational unit for autobiographical memories. In contrast, the difficulty of emotional memory generation implies that emotions represent low-level event information in the organization of autobiographical memory."

To this end, we propose a fast view-based 3D model retrieval framework in this article. This framework comprises two parts: the first one is an Unsupervised Multiple Feature Fusion algorithm (UMFF), which is used to learn a compact yet discriminative feature representation from the original multiple visual features; and the second one is an efficient Online Projection Learning algorithm (OPL), which is designed to fast transfer the input multiple visual features of a newcome model into its corresponding low-dimensional feature representation. In this framework, many existing ranking algorithms such as the simple distance-based ranking method can be directly adopted for sorting all 3D models in the database using the learned new feature representation and returning the top ranked models to the user. Extensive experiments on two public 3D model databases demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach over its competitors. The proposed framework cannot only dramatically improve the retrieval performance but also reduce the computational cost in dealing with the newcome models."

For each feature point, a MSC descriptor is devised to capture the multiple spatial information on the basis of the intrinsic shape context, which is advantageous in solving the domain offset deficiency for intra-class shapes. Different from the traditional shape context method, the MSC descriptor is built based on the charts without angular bins and the shape distributions in local domains, which makes it not only simple but also efficient. To reduce the cost of shape representation, we detect a sparse set of feature points and design an improved bags-of-word model to encode the MSC descriptors. For retrieval improvement, an efficient while robust re-ranking algorithm by metric mapping is designed to alleviate the errors of the feature space. Finally, the experimental results have demonstrated significant performance gains on two public benchmarks."

There is a clear need to introduce fast systems integrated with modern image processing and analysis algorithms to accelerate the process. In this paper, we describe the development of an automated moth species identification and retrieval system (SPIR) using computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. The core of the system is a probabilistic model that infers Semantically Related Visual (SRV) attributes from low-level visual features of moth images in the training set, where moth wings are segmented into information-rich patches from which the local features are extracted, and the SRV attributes are provided by human experts as ground-truth. For the large amount of unlabeled test images in the database or added into the database later on, an automated identification process is evoked to translate the detected salient regions of low-level visual features on the moth wings into meaningful semantic SRV attributes. We further propose a novel network analysis based approach to explore and utilize the co-occurrence patterns of SRV attributes as contextual cues to improve individual attribute detection accuracy. Working with a small set of labeled training images, the approach constructs a network with nodes representing the SRV attributes and weighted edges denoting the co-occurrence correlation. A fast modularity maximization algorithm is proposed to detect the co-occurrence patterns as communities in the network. A random walk process working on the discovered co-occurrence patterns is applied to refine the individual attribute detection results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in automated moth identification and attribute-based image retrieval. In addition, a novel image descriptor called SRV attribute signature is introduced to record the visual and semantic properties of an image and is used to compare image similarity. Experiments are performed on an existing entomology database to illustrate the capabilities of our proposed system. We observed that the system performance is improved by the SRV attribute representation and their co-occurrence patterns."

GNSS-R signal-based online SM retrieval and real-time product sharing has advantages over other methods because it features the instant and automatic retrieval of SM, and low-latency SM product publishing and sharing, enabling a notable decrease in human and material resource consumption and a timely SM product delivery; however, prior to this manuscript, there has not been a study describing how to do it. This paper uses one type of GNSS-R signals, the Beidou navigation satellite system-reflectometry (BDS-R) signal, as the data source and proposes a geospatial web-enabled BDS-R (GWEB) service. This method tackles the problems of SM retrieval and sharing by implementing the original BDS-R signal publishing, the online SM retrieval, and the SM product sharing. In the GWEB service, a web processing service is adopted to encapsulate the SM retrieval algorithm, and a sensor observation service is applied to publish the original BDS-R observations and the SM products. Signals of the Baoxie BDS-R SM monitoring station in Wuhan, China for the period of November 17, 2014 to November 24, 2014 are used as input in the validation experiment, and the SM products are demonstrated in the sharing platform. Meanwhile, the BDS-R derived SM products are compared with the corresponding SM values measured by ground soil hygrometers, indicating the feasibility of the service for online SM retrieval and sharing."

An approach to analyze a trajectory dataset has concentrated on semantic region retrieval, which extracts some regions in which have their own patterns of object movements. Semantic region retrieval has become an important topic since the semantic regions are useful for various applications, such as activity analysis. The previous literatures, however, have just revealed semantically relevant points, rather than actual regions, and have less consideration of temporal dependency of observations in a trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel model for trajectory analysis and semantic region retrieval. We first extend the meaning of semantic regions that can cover actual regions. We build a model for the extended semantic regions based on a hierarchically linked infinite hidden Markov model, which can capture the temporal dependency between adjacent observations, and retrieve the semantic regions from a trajectory dataset. In addition, we propose a sticky extension to diminish redundant semantic regions that occur in a non-sticky model. The experimental results demonstrate that our models well extract semantic regions from a real trajectory dataset."

It encodes spatio-temporal information in the synaptic weights as it associates a learned input with a specific response. We introduce a correlation measure to evaluate the precision of the spiking patterns and explore the effects of different inhibitory interactions and learning parameters. We find that large learning periods are important in order to improve the network learning capacity and discuss this ability in the presence of distinct inhibitory currents."

We refer to this as the PD-LST retrieval. Our method has two main components. First, we calculate a topic-word significance value for each visual word given a certain latent topic to evaluate how the word is connected to this latent topic. The latent topics are learnt, based on the relationship between the images and words, and are employed to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics. These latent topics describe the images and words semantically and can thus facilitate more meaningful comparisons between the words. Second, we compute an overall-word significance value to evaluate the significance of a visual word within the entire dictionary. We designed an iterative ranking method to measure overall-word significance by considering the relationship between all latent topics and words. The words with higher values are considered meaningful with more significant discriminative power in differentiating medical images.

If existing CAD models have design information related to the design of a new product, their reuse saves costs and reduces time of product design.

In this paper, we propose an approach to retrieving CAD models with design documents. A major challenge of the proposed approach was reduction of semantic gap between design documents and CAD models because design documents generated in the early design stage contain abstract design descriptions, while CAD models contain detailed design descriptions. In order to reduce the semantic gap between CAD models and design documents, we adopt semantic processing and rule processing. During the semantic processing, semantic representations are generated from the text in CAD models and text in design documents using a domain ontology and shallow natural language processing (NLP). Hidden design information is extracted from CAD models and design documents based on rule processing. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform the keyword-based approach which does not overcome semantic gap."

        "abstract": "A recent study by Van der Schalie et al. (2015) showed good results for applying the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) on SMOS observations over southeast Australia and optimizing and evaluating the retrieved soil moisture (\u03b8 in m3 m\u22123) against ground measurements from the OzNet sites. In this study, the LPRM parameterization is globally updated for SMOS against modelled \u03b8 from MERRA-Land (MERRA) and ERA-Interim/Land (ERA) over the period of July 2010\u2013December 2010, mainly focusing on two parameters: the single scattering albedo (\u03c9) and the roughness (h). The Pearson's coefficient of correlation (r) increased rapidly when increasing the \u03c9 up to 0.12 and reached a steady state from thereon, no significant spatial pattern was found in the estimation of the single scattering albedo, which could be an artifact of the used parameter estimation procedure, and a single value of 0.12 was therefore used globally. The h was defined as a function of \u03b8 and varied slightly for the different angle bins, with maximum values of 1.1\u20131.3 as the angle changes from 42.5\u00b0 to 57.5\u00b0.This resulted in an average r of 0.51 and 0.47, with a bias (m3 m\u22123) of \u22120.02 and \u22120.01 and an unbiased root mean square error (ubrmse in m3 m\u22123) of 0.054 and 0.056 against MERRA (ascending and descending). For ERA this resulted in an r of 0.61 and 0.53, with a bias of \u22120.03 and an ubrmse 0.055 and 0.059. The resulting parameterization was then used to run LPRM on SMOS observations over the period of July 2010\u2013December 2013 and evaluated against SMOS Level 3 (L3) \u03b8 and available in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The comparison with L3 shows that the LPRM \u03b8 retrievals are very similar, with for the ascending set very high r of over 0.9 in large parts of the globe, with an overall average of 0.85 and the descending set performing less with an average of 0.74, mainly due to the negative r over the Sahara. The mean bias is 0.03, with an ubrmse of 0.038 and 0.044. In this study there are three major areas where the LPRM retrievals do not perform well: very dry sandy areas, densely forested areas and over high latitudes, which are all known limitations of LPRM. The comparison against in situ measurement from the ISMN give very similar results, with average r for LPRM of 0.65 and 0.61 (0.64 and 0.59 for L3) for the ascending and descending sets, while having a comparable bias and ubrmse over the different networks. This shows that LPRM used on SMOS observations produce \u03b8 retrievals with a similar quality as the SMOS L3 product."

We integrate these information as image attributes via an extended image graph and propose a graph traversal algorithm to efficiently obtain their values. By comprehensively considering these attributes, we propose an attribute similarity measure for re-ranking, which brings much performance improvement. We further use our method for the multiple-query retrieval with a simple extension of the virtual query. The experimental results show that our method significantly improve the baseline approach and achieves competitive performance compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.

Among tremendous amount of photos, a significant fraction contains human faces. Faces are usually salient features of the photos. To understand and extract useful information from such gigantic data corpus, efficient and effective retrieval algorithms are demanded. Most face retrieval techniques rely on low-level image features to compare faces based on visual similarity. However, as humans we tend to simplify the recognition task by utilizing human attributes such as gender or race to help differentiate people on a higher semantic level. In this paper, we propose to use human attributes as high-level semantic cues to determine people\u05f3s identities. To this end, we develop discriminative image features with attribute information encoded to achieve more accurate face image retrieval. To guarantee scalability, we propose using a binary coding scheme for the proposed attributed-based features. A re-ranking step after initial retrieval is incorporated to further improve the retrieval performance. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art on the LFW and Pubfig face datasets."

The two algorithms we use, phase propagation or the kernel method, are polynomial time in the dimension d. To ensure a successful approximate recovery, we assume that the noise is sufficiently small compared to the squared norm of the vector to be recovered. In this regime, we derive an explicit error bound that is inverse proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio, with a constant of proportionality that depends only on the dimension d. Properties of the reproducing kernel space of complex polynomials and of trigonometric polynomials are central in our error estimates."

        "abstract": "The recent overwhelming increase in the amount of available visual information, especially digital images, has brought up a pressing need to develop efficient and accurate systems for image retrieval. State-of-the-art systems for image retrieval use the bag-of-visual-words representation of images. However, the computational bottleneck in all such systems is the construction of the visual codebook, i.e., obtaining the visual words. This is typically performed by clustering hundreds of thousands or millions of local descriptors, where the resulting clusters correspond to visual words. Each image is then represented by a histogram of the distribution of its local descriptors across the codebook. The major issue in retrieval systems is that by increasing the sizes of the image databases, the number of local descriptors to be clustered increases rapidly: Thus, using conventional clustering techniques is infeasible. Considering this, we propose to construct the visual codebook by using predictive clustering trees (PCTs), which can be constructed and executed efficiently and have good predictive performance. Moreover, to increase the stability of the model, we propose to use random forests of predictive clustering trees. We create a random forest of PCTs that represents both the codebook and the indexing structure. We evaluate the proposed improvement of the bag-of-visual-words approach on three reference datasets and two additional datasets of 100 K images and 1 M images, compare it to two state-of-the-art methods based on approximate k-means and extremely randomized tree ensembles. The results reveal that the proposed method produces a visual codebook with superior discriminative power and thus better retrieval performance while maintaining excellent computational efficiency."

For example, O3 spectra in the stratosphere are stronger during the day than at night. Conversely, spectra in the MLT region at night are stronger than those occurring during the day due to diurnal variations in O3 behavior. These opposing behaviors cause problems, including oscillations and inaccuracies particularly for O3 vertical profiles in the MLT region retrieved with an application of one retrieval procedure for the entire vertical range (stratosphere to thermosphere). Recently, we developed an optimal retrieval method for O3 in the MLT region for spectra, observed by the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) instrument on the International Space Station. Optimizations were performed for frequency window range, retrieval vertical range, vertical grids, and a priori information for O3 and temperature. Precision and accuracy were evaluated by error analysis and comparisons with previous products. The random error was estimated to be about 5% and 35% in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, respectively, for nighttime O3 profiles in the MLT region. The total systematic error was about 6% in the MLT region. Certain improvements for both random noise (from 50% to 35%) and systematic error (from 10% to 6%) were obtained. We succeeded in revealing the positive correlation between O3 and ClO at nighttime in the upper mesosphere using the optimized O3 profiles; furthermore, its chemical mechanism was explained quantitatively."

In this paper, improved cloud phase retrieval approaches using a supervised Back-Propagation Neural Network (BP-NN), and an unsupervised Self-Organizing Feature Map Neural Network (SOFM-NN) were proposed and investigated. The results of this study indicated that the two ANN approaches are satisfactory in discriminating cloud phase using FY-3A/Visible and InfRared Radiometer (VIRR) multi-channel data, and the average accuracy rates for the BP-NN approach are 93.50%, 93.81%, 94.25%, and 93.38% for the winter, spring, summer, and fall season categories, respectively, while for the SOFM-NN approach, rates are 91.93%, 92.08%, 92.63%, and 91.97%, respectively. The BP-NN approach performs slightly better than the SOFM-NN approach. Moreover, the two ANN approaches are found to perform more accurately than the current FY-3A operational product. Therefore, our work demonstrated that the ANN approaches provide an attractive alternative for cloud phase retrieval that could potentially be used to upgrade the current threshold technique used for the FY-3A operational product."

The linking solution approach uses traffic process approximations to analyze the performance of sub-models corresponding to individual tiers (semi-open queues) and the vertical transfer units (open queues). These sub-models are linked to form an integrated queuing network model, which is solved using an iterative algorithm. Performance estimates such as expected transaction cycle times and resource (vehicle and vertical transfer unit) utilization are determined using this algorithm, and can be used to evaluate a variety of design configurations during the conceptualization phase."

Moreover, a fused feature is not flexible enough to adapt to the variety of images.

Moreover, for feature salience enhancement, a query model based on ordinary-least-squared (OLS) regression is established for rank aggregation. The query model weighs each feature according to its retrieval performance and then selects the target images.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that these automated compiled procedures are restricted to small quantities that do not exceed the size of the focus of attention (i.e., 4 elements). For this purpose, we analyzed the response times of ninety adult participants when solving the 81 additions with operands from 1 to 9. Even when focusing on small problems (i.e. with sums \u2a7d10) reported by participants as being solved by direct retrieval, chronometric analyses revealed a strong size effect. Response times increased linearly with the magnitude of the operands testifying for the involvement of a sequential multistep procedure. However, this size effect was restricted to the problems involving operands from 1 to 4, whereas the pattern of response times for other small problems was compatible with a retrieval hypothesis. These findings suggest that very fast responses routinely interpreted as reflecting direct retrieval of the answer from memory actually subsume compiled automated procedures that are faster than retrieval and deliver their answer while the subject remains unaware of their process, mistaking them for direct retrieval from long-term memory."

The possible influence of the anxiolytic action of BDZs on their effects on memory retrieval and extinction are poorly understood. This is relevant considering the relationship between aversive memories and anxiety disorders. We designed a modified protocol of PMDAT that evaluates anxiety during retrieval and extinction of the task. Male Wistar rats were trained in the PMDAT (plus-maze with two open and two enclosed arms) using a standard or a modified protocol. In the standard protocol, the aversive stimuli were presented in one of the enclosed arms during training, and the animal had free access to the whole apparatus. In the modified protocol, the open arms were blocked with glass walls. Twenty-four hours after training, the animals subjected to each of the protocols were treated with saline or 2.0 mg/kg of diazepam (DZP) 30 min before the test. There was a third session in the maze (retest) 24 h after the test. During the test, DZP impaired and improved retrieval in rats that had been trained in the standard and the modified protocol when compared to the respective saline-treated groups. In addition, treatment with DZP prior to the test induced anxiolysis, but only in the animals that were not pre-exposed to the open arms of the apparatus (modified protocol). In these animals, DZP impaired extinction, which was evaluated during retest session. The impairing effect of DZP on extinction seems to be related to its anxiolytic action during the test (extinction learning). Further, we suggest that aversive memory retrieval depends on both the treatment and the arousal elicited by exposure to the apparatus."

        "abstract": "Episodic autobiographical memory (ABM) has been found to be impaired from the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous works have focused on how ABM decreases over the lifespan, but no study has deeply investigated whether the extent of episodic autobiographical amnesia is mediated by the retrieval frequency of the episodic trace itself. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the frequency of trace retrieval has an effect on the quality of autobiographical incidents recall and whether the extent of this contribution changes over time. For this purpose, the episodic component of ABM was assessed in patients in the early stage of AD through a questionnaire which allowed evaluating memory of past personal incidents as a function of both their age of acquisition and retrieval frequency. We found that both AD patients and healthy controls took advantage of greater retrieval frequency across all time segments, because of their better memory performance on frequently retrieved episodes than less frequently retrieved ones. Although in the AD group the retrieval frequency effect (i.e., higher scores on the episodes rated as more frequently retrieved) was found in all time segments, the extent of its beneficial effect on memory performance was temporally-graded and inversely related to the time course. Our findings provide new evidence that the combined action of both age of memory and retrieval frequency could provide a valuable framework for predicting patterns of ABM loss, at least in early AD patients. In line with the Multiple Trace Theory, we speculated that retrieval frequency protects episodic trace recall against hippocampal damage by reinforcing the neural representation of personal context-rich memories, which consequently are easier to access and recall. Furthermore, the age of memory should change the amplitude of this beneficial effect as a function of the remoteness of the trace."

The standard local binary patterns (LBP) and local ternary patterns (LTP) encode the gray scale relationship between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in two dimensional (2D) local region of an image whereas the former descriptor encodes the gray scale relationship among the neighbors for a given center pixel with three selected directions of mess patterns which is generated from 2D image and later descriptor encodes the spatial relation between any pair of neighbors in a local region along the given directions (i.e., 0\u030a, 45\u030a, 90\u030a and 135\u030a) for a given center pixel in an image. The novelty of the proposed descriptors is that they use ternary patterns from images to encode more spatial structure information which lead to better retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the new techniques in terms of average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) over state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques (like LBP, LTP, LQEP, LMeP etc.) on three different types of benchmark biomedical databases."

To better understand whether these brain regions functionally interact during memory processing and how the passage of time affects these interactions, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from these three regions as well as anterior dorsal thalamus (ADT), which provides one of the strongest inputs to RSC, and measured coherence of oscillatory activity within the theta (4\u201312 Hz) and gamma (30\u201380 Hz) frequency bands. We identified changes of theta coherence related to encoding, retrieval, and extinction of context fear, whereas changes in gamma coherence were restricted to fear extinction. Specifically, exposure to a novel context and retrieval of recently acquired fear conditioning memory were associated with increased theta coherence between RSC and all three other structures. In contrast, RSC\u2013DH and RSC\u2013ADT theta coherence were decreased in mice that successfully retrieved, relative to mice that failed to retrieve, remote memory. Greater RSC\u2013ADT theta and gamma coherence were observed during recent, compared to remote, extinction of freezing responses. Thus, the degree of coherence between RSC and connected brain areas may predict and contribute to context memory retrieval and retrieval-related phenomena such as fear extinction. Importantly, although theta coherence in this circuit increases during memory encoding and retrieval of recent memory, failure to decrease RSC\u2013DH theta coherence might be linked to retrieval deficit in the long term, and possibly contribute to aberrant memory processing characteristic of neuropsychiatric disorders."

Recently, special attention has been paid to quantitative phase retrieval in X-ray grating interferometry, which is mandatory to perform phase tomography, to achieve material identification, etc. An innovative approach, dubbed \u201cReverse Projection\u201d (RP), has been developed for quantitative phase retrieval. The RP method abandons grating scanning completely, and is thus advantageous in terms of higher efficiency and reduced radiation damage. Therefore, it is expected that this novel method would find its potential in preclinical and clinical implementations. Strictly speaking, the reverse projection method is applicable for objects exhibiting only absorption and refraction. In this contribution, we discuss the phase retrieval with the reverse projection method for general objects with absorption, refraction and scattering simultaneously. Especially, we investigate the influence of the object's scattering on the retrieved refraction signal. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are performed. The results show that the retrieved refraction signal is the product of object's refraction and scattering signals for small values. In the case of a strong scattering, the reverse projection method cannot provide reliable phase retrieval. Those presented results will guide the use of the reverse projection method for future practical applications, and help to explain some possible artifacts in the retrieved images and/or reconstructed slices."

In this paper, we evaluated biomass estimation from L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and the improvement of accuracy by adding canopy height information derived from stereo imagery acquired by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Various models for prediction of forest biomass from UAVSAR data were investigated at pixel sizes of 1/4 ha (50 m \u00d7 50 m) and 1 ha. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each of the explanatory variables in multivariable regression models to assess the multi-collinearity between explanatory variables. In addition, the t- and p-values were used to interpret the significance of the coefficients of each explanatory variables. The R2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and bootstrapping were used to validate models. At 1/4-ha scale, the R2 and RMSE of biomass estimation from a model using a single track of polarimetric UAVSAR data were 0.59 and 52.08 Mg/ha. With canopy height from PRISM as additional independent variable, R2 increased to 0.76 and RMSE decreased to 39.74 Mg/ha (28.24%). At 1-ha scale, the RMSE of biomass estimation based on UAVSAR data of a single track was 39.42 Mg/ha with a R2 of 0.77. With the canopy height from PRISM, R2 increased to 0.86 and RMSE decreased to 29.47 Mg/ha (20.18%). The models using UAVSAR data alone underestimated biomass at levels above ~ 150 Mg/ha showing the saturation phenomenon. Adding canopy height from PRISM stereo imagery significantly improved the biomass estimation and elevated the saturation level in estimating biomass. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation at 1/4-ha scale, R2 increased from 0.59 to 0.66 and RMSE reduced from 52.08 to 48.57 Mg/ha. Averaging multiple acquisitions of UAVSAR data from the same look azimuth direction did not improve biomass estimation. A biomass map derived from NASA's LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging System) waveform data was used as a reference for evaluation of the biomass maps from these models. The study has also shown that the errors decreased when deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests were modeled separately but the improvement was not significant."

Moreover, considering that a same joint can be defined in multiple ways, this work provides also a method for retrieving assemblies in a dataset according to the part relationships and their class of equivalence."

To address this issue, we put forward a novel cross-modal hashing method named Semantic Boosting Cross-Modal Hashing (SBCMH). To preserve the semantic similarity, we first apply multi-class logistic regression to project heterogeneous data into a semantic space, respectively. To further narrow the semantic gap between different modalities, we then use a joint boosting framework to learn hash functions, and finally transform the mapped data representations into a measurable binary subspace. Comparative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBCMH."

This paper proposes a novel method of extracting Fourier descriptors that preserve the phase of Fourier coefficients. We introduce specific points, called pseudomirror points, and use them as a shape orientation reference. They facilitate the extraction of phase-preserving Fourier descriptors which are invariant under translation, scaling, rotation and starting point change. The proposed descriptor was tested on four popular benchmarking datasets: MPEG7 CE-1 Set B, Swedish leaf, ETH-80 and Kimia99 datasets. Performance and computational complexity measures indicate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art phase-based Fourier descriptors. In addition, it outperforms other state-of-the-art magnitude-based Fourier descriptors, and many non-Fourier based shape description methods in terms of performance \u2013 complexity ratio."

Hapke (2012b) designed a photometric model providing an approximate analytical solution of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of a particulate medium: he introduced the effect of surface roughness as a correction factor of the BRDF of a smooth surface. This photometric roughness is defined as the mean slope angle of the facets composing the surface, integrated over all scales from the grain size to the local topography. Yet its physical meaning is still a question at issue, as the scale at which it occurs is not clearly defined. This work aims at better understanding the relative influence of roughness scales on soil BRDF and to test the ability of the Hapke model to retrieve a roughness that depicts effectively the ground truth. We apply a wavelet transform on millimeter digital terrain models (DTM) acquired over volcanic terrains. This method allows splitting the frequency band of a signal in several sub-bands, each corresponding to a spatial scale. We demonstrate that sub-centimeter surface features dominate both the integrated roughness and the BRDF shape. We investigate the suitability of the Hapke model for surface roughness retrieval by inversion on optical data. A global sensitivity analysis of the model shows that soil BRDF is very sensitive to surface roughness, nearly as much as the single scattering albedo according to the phase angle, but also that these two parameters are strongly correlated. Based on these results, a simplified two-parameter model depending on surface albedo and roughness is proposed. Inversion of this model on BRDF data simulated by a ray-tracing code over natural targets shows a good estimation of surface roughness when the assumptions of the model are verified, with a priori knowledge on surface albedo."

These studies suggest that older adults exhibit a reduction in frequency of both mind-wandering and involuntary autobiographical memory, whereas findings regarding intrusive thoughts have been more mixed. Additionally, there is some preliminary evidence that spontaneous prospective memory retrieval may be relatively preserved in aging. We consider the roles of age-related differences in cognitive resources, motivation, current concerns and emotional regulation in accounting for these findings.

Hence, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has become one of the most active research areas for the last few decades. However, it is still an open issue to narrow down the gap between the high level semantics in the human minds and the low level features computable by machines. This paper proposes a multiple-instance learning based decision neural network (MI-BDNN) that attempts to bridge the semantic ga in CBIR. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is a variation of supervised learning, where the training set is composed of many bags, and each bag contains many instances. If a bag contains at least one positive instance, it is labelled as a positive bag; otherwise, it is labelled as a negative bag. A novel discriminant function and learning schemes are employed in the MI-BDNN to learn the concept from the training bags. The proposed approach considers the image retrieval problem as a MIL problem, where a user\u05f3s preferred image concept is learned by training MI-BDNN with a set of exemplar images, each of which is labelled as conceptual related (positive) or conceptual unrelated (negative) image. The MI-BDNN based CBIR system is developed, and the results of the experiments showed that MI-BDNN can successfully be used for real image retrieval and classification problems."

The number of Gaussian components (i.e., the number of quantized color bins) is determined automatically according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Second, we incorporate the spatiogram representation with the quantized Gaussian mixture color model. Intuitively, a spatiogram is a histogram in which the distribution of colors is spatially weighted by the locations of the pixels contributing to each color bin. We have modified the spatiogram representation to fit our framework, which employs Gaussian color components instead of discrete color bins. Finally, the comparison between two images is achieved by measuring the similarity between two spatiograms, for which purpose we propose a new measurement adopting the Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence (JSD). We applied the new image representation and comparison method to the image retrieval task. The experiments on several publicly available COREL image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image representation for image retrieval."

Vice versa, old-high participants demonstrated more activity than either the young or the old-low group in the right frontal gyrus, associated with more accurate memory performance, and in the left frontal gyrus. In sum, the present study clearly showed that age differences in the neural correlates of retrieval success were modulated by task difficulty, as suggested by the CRUNCH model, but also by interindividual variability, in particular regarding executive functioning."

Although this technique achieves high retrieval accurateness, the precision value is low down. In order to enhance the efficiency and precision value even more higher a Haar wavelet based LTRP technique is proposed in this paper. To extract the object feature instead of earlier new watershed segmentation(NWS) method, Haar wavelet based LTRP technique is used. In the proposed technique, at first the visual features are removed from the images by means of the spatial spectral heterogeneity technique. Afterwards the object features are removed by applying the Haar wavelet and the object features are extracted from the wavelet band by developing LTRP method and the Extracted object features are classified by Neuro-Fuzzy system typically known as ANFIS. Subsequently Scene semantic models are used for the recovery of parallel scene images from the database. The projected RSIR system based on Haar wavelet-LTRP and ANFIS technique are executed in working platform of MATLAB. The performance is measured by utilizing a compilation of remote sensing images taken from the database. In addition the recital is examined by comparing the projected Haar wavelet-LTRP method with the NWSRSIR and the usual SBRSIR method in terms of performance estimate metrics such as precision, recall and F-Measure rate. The implementation effects show the competence of projected Haar wavelet based LTRP method in Remote sensing image retrieval method."

However, it is still a challenging task to model 3D human motions due to its large spatio-temporal variations. This paper proposes a novel graph-based method for real time 3D human motion retrieval. Firstly, we propose a novel graph construction method which connects the joints that are deemed important for a given motion. In particular, the top-N Relative Ranges of Joint Relative Distances (RRJRD) were proposed to determine which joints should be connected in the resulting graph because these measures indicate the normalized activity levels among the joint pairs. Different motions may thus result in different graph structures so the construction of the graphs is made adaptive to the characteristics of a given motion and is able to represent a meaningful spatial structure. In addition to the spatial structure, the temporal pyramid of covariance descriptors was adopted to preserve certain level of spatio-temporal local features. The graph kernel is computed by matching the walks from each of the two graphs to be matched. Furthermore, multiple kernel learning was applied to determine the optimal weights for combining the graph kernels to measure the overall similarity between two motions. The experimental results show that our method is robust under several variations, and demonstrates superior performance in comparison to three state-of-the-art methods."

In this paper, we propose a new method called the Kernelized Sparse Hashing, which generates sparse hash codes with \u21131 and non-negative regularizations. Compared to traditional hashing methods, our method only activates a small number of relevant bits on the hash code and hence provides a more compact and interpretable representation of data. Moreover, the kernel trick is introduced to capture the nonlinear similarity of features, and the local geometrical structure of data is explicitly considered in our method to improve the retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments on three large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the examined state-of-the-art techniques."

Since each visual feature reflects a unique characteristic about the model, they have unequal discriminative power with respect to a specific category of 3D model, and they are complementary to each other in model representation. Thus, it would be beneficial to combine multiple visual features together in 3D model retrieval. In light of this, we propose an efficient Semi-supervised Multiple Feature Fusion (SMFF) method for view-based 3D model retrieval in this paper. Specifically, We first extract multiple visual features to describe both the local and global appearance characteristics of multiple 2D projected images that are generated from 3D models. Then, SMFF is adopted to learn a more compact and discriminative low-dimensional feature representation via multiple feature fusion using both the labeled and unlabeled 3D models. Once the low-dimensional features have been learned, many existing methods such as SVM and KNN can be used in the subsequent retrieval phase. Moreover, an out-of-sample extension of SMFF is provided to calculate the low-dimensional features for the newly added 3D models in linear time. Experiments on two public 3D model datasets demonstrate that using such a learned feature representation can significantly improve the performance of 3D model retrieval and the proposed method outperforms the other competitors."

In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (ZSD) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution). The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (aCDOM(442) ranging 1.7\u20134.0 m\u22121), Chl a concentration (0.5\u201373 mg m\u22123) and total suspended matter (0.7\u201337.5 g m\u22123) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m &lt; ZSD &lt; 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R2). The accuracy increased (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when ZSD was retrieved via an empirical relationship between ZSD and Kd(490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when ZSD was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived ZSD product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes."

Here, we report the first brain stimulation experiment to directly test this hypothesis. We administered tDCS to dlPFC immediately after studying to-be-learned material but just prior to recollection testing, thereby targeting retrieval processes. We found that stimulation of dlPFC significantly increased recollection accuracy, relative to a no-stimulation sham condition and also relative to active stimulation of a comparison region in left parietal cortex. There was no significant difference in the size of this increase between hemispheres. Moreover, these dlPFC stimulation effects were behaviorally selective, increasing accuracy only when participants needed to recollect difficult information. Electrically stimulating dlPFC allowed people to more accurately recollect specific details of their experiences, demonstrating a causal role of dlPFC in the retrieval of episodic memories."

The common modality used for image search on the web is based on text, the assumption being that the tags and the textual descriptions associated with photos are powerful ways to describe and retrieve images. The results are usually obtained by simply matching the terms of the query to an index of terms associated to the images in a corpus. The efficiency of this technique depends strongly on the tags associated to pictures, as well as their accuracy. Trying to search for images with bridges in this kind of systems, the result set will only contain images explicitly annotated with this term, but will fail to include images with Pont Neuf or Ponte Vecchio, if their tags do not contain the noun bridge.

Taking the limited bandwidth and instability of wireless channel into account, in this paper we propose an effective scalable mobile image retrieval approach by exploiting the advantage of mobile end that people usually take multiple photos of an object in different viewpoints and focuses. The proposed algorithm first determines the truly relevant photos according to visual similarity in mobile end, then learns salient visual words by exploring saliency from these relevant images, and finally determines the contribution order of salient visual words to carry out scalable retrieval. Moreover, to improve the retrieval performance, soft spatial verification is proposed to re-rank the results. Compared to the existing approaches of mobile image retrieval, our approach transmits less data and reduces the computational cost of spatial verification. Most importantly, when the bandwidth is limited, we can transmit only a part of features according their contributions to retrieval. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We here develop the first processing system to identify active fires and retrieve their fire radiative power (FRP) from AHI data, based on the geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) algorithm and FRP retrieval method originally developed for use with Meteosat SEVIRI over Africa and Europe. This scheme detects active fires covering as little as 10\u2212 3 to 10\u2212 4 of an AHI pixel, and we compare performance to the same scheme applied to data from the forerunner geostationary MTSAT imager and the FengYun-2 (FY-2) Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR), and also to 1 km (at nadir) polar-orbiting MODIS active fire data. We find major benefits of Himawari-8 AHI over both MTSAT and FY-2, being able to detect a substantially greater proportion of fire activity and with little impact from sensor saturation. AHI-derived FRP retrievals of detected fires show a very strong agreement and a low (3 MW) bias with respect to near-simultaneous MODIS retrievals, though fires having FRP \u2264 40 MW are undercounted by AHI due to its 4 \u00d7 larger pixel area (at nadir) than MODIS. Large parts of Asia are characterised by smaller/lower FRP fires associated with e.g. agricultural residue burning, meaning many are at or below this AHI minimum FRP detection limit, and during June 2015 AHI fails to detect around 66% of the hotspots that MODIS detects when both sensors view the same area simultaneously. However, AHI provides 144 observation opportunities per day compared to 4 typical observations from MODIS, and shows a low (8%) active fire detection error of commission. We demonstrate the unique value of the geostationary FRP retrievals made from AHI data for full fire diurnal cycle assessment and for Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) calculations. We conclude that these FRP data demonstrate major benefits for studies of active fires over Asia and Australia, and expect them to become an important component of the global geostationary active fire observation system."

But it remains to be determined which neural systems are functionally affected during memory retrieval after one night of recovery sleep. To investigate this issue, we evaluated memory for pairs of famous people's faces with the same or different profession (i.e., semantically congruent or incongruent faces) after one night of undisturbed sleep in subjects who either underwent 4 hours of acute sleep restriction (ASR, N = 20) or who slept 8 hours the pre-training night (controls, N = 20). EEG recordings were collected during the recognition memory task in both groups, and the cortical sources generating this activity localized by applying a spatial beamforming filter in the frequency domain. Even though sleep restriction did not affect accuracy of memory performance, controls showed a much larger decrease of alpha power relative to a baseline period when compared to sleep-deprived subjects. These group differences affected a widespread frontotemporoparietal network involved in retrieval of episodic/semantic memories. Regression analyses further revealed that associative memory in the ASR group was negatively correlated with alpha power in the occipital regions, whereas the benefit of congruency in the same group was positively correlated with delta power in the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Retrieval-related decreases of alpha power have been associated with the reactivation of material-specific memory representations, whereas increases of delta power have been related to inhibition of interferences that may affect the performance of the task. We can therefore draw the conclusion that a few hours of sleep loss in the pre-training night, though insufficient to change the memory performance, is sufficient to alter the processes involved in retrieving and manipulating episodic and semantic information."

For tagging data, a new interpretation is adopted to distinguish the relevant tags and irrelevant tags instead of the typically used binary scheme.

The projection makes convenient to embed any images including out-of-samples into the latent space. That is, the proposed method enables to handle the out-of-sample problem. The \u2113 2 , 1 -norm regularization makes the transformation matrix suitable for selecting the effective features.

An original image is decomposed into three complementary components: amplitude, orientation and phase by monogenic signal representation. The monogenic variation in each local region and monogenic feature in each pixel are encoded, and then the statistical features of the local features encoded are calculated. In order to overcome the problem of high feature dimensionality, the local statistical features extracted from the complementary monogenic components are projected by block-based fisher discriminant analysis, which not only reduces the dimensionality of the features extracted, but also enhances its discriminative power. Finally, these features reduced are fused for effective image retrieval. Experimental results show that our scheme can effectively describe an image, and obviously improve the average retrieval precision."

Although this work has largely focused on the changes that these memory traces undergo over time, an unexplored issue is whether retrieval attempts and other strategic processes might be differentially oriented in order to effectively access memories of different ages. The current study addressed this issue by instructing participants to retrieve words that were encoded either one week (remote) or about 30 minutes earlier (recent). To maximize the possibility that participants adopted distinct retrieval orientations, separate blocks of the memory test employed exclusion task procedures in which the words from only one encoding period were targeted at a given time, in the face of distractors from the other period. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by correctly-rejected new items were contrasted to minimize confounding effects of retrieval success. The new-item ERPs revealed differences according to the targeted week, such that the ERPs over posterior scalp were more positive-going for the recent compared to remote blocks. Furthermore, using multiple methods, these ERP effects were dissociated from differences in difficulty across the two conditions. The findings provide novel evidence that knowledge about when a memory was initially encoded leads to differences in the adoption of retrieval processing strategies."

        "abstract": "The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) satellite mission, candidate of ESA's 8th Earth Explorer program, is explicitly optimized for detecting the sun-induced fluorescence emitted by plants. It will allow consistent measurements around the O2-B (687 nm) and O2-A (760 nm) bands, related to the red and far-red fluorescence emission peaks respectively, the photochemical reflectance index, and the structural-chemical state variables of the canopy. The sun-induced fluorescence signal, overlapped to the surface reflected radiance, can be accurately retrieved by employing the powerful spectral fitting technique. In this framework, a set of fluorescence retrieval algorithms optimized for FLEX are proposed in this study. Two main retrieval approaches were investigated: i) the optimization of the spectral fitting for retrieving fluorescence at the oxygen absorption bands; ii) the extension of the spectral fitting to a broader spectral window to retrieve the full fluorescence spectrum in the range from 670 to 780 nm. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithms is assessed by employing atmosphere-surface radiative transfer simulations obtained by coupling SCOPE and MODTRAN5 codes. The simulated dataset considers more realistic conditions because it includes directional effects, and the top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra are resampled to the current specifications of the FLuORescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) planned to serve as the primary instrument aboard FLEX. The retrieval accuracy obtained at the O2-A band is strongly affected by directional effects, and better performance is found in cases where directional effects are lower. However, the best performing algorithms tested provided similar performance, the RMSE (RRMSE) is 0.044 mW m\u2212 2 sr\u2212 1 nm\u2212 1 (6.2%) at the O2-A band, 0.018 mW m\u2212 2 sr\u2212 1 nm\u2212 1 (2.9%) at the O2-B band, and 6.225 mW m\u2212 2 sr\u2212 1 (6.4%) for the spectrally integrated fluorescence emission. The promising results achieved open new perspectives extending fluorescence studies not only in limited absorption bands, but its spectral behavior in relation to different plant species, photosynthetic rates and stress occurrences."

However, it is also noticed that the dimensionality of BoW is usually as high as a few hundreds or even thousands, posing a serious challenge for any application that requires efficient processing. In this paper we propose a dimension reduction method called Meta object-Group Component (MGC) to tackle this problem. MGC aims at discovering the hidden relations of objects by examining the correlations between dimensions in the BoW features and maximizing the relations of the members in a meta object-group. By exchanging message passing between object-groups, meta object-groups are identified for a dataset. A meta object-group does not only contain visually similar objects, but also includes objects that are likely to co-occur with each other. As the meta object groups are obtained, group-specific dimension reduction is performed to obtain denser representations for efficient retrieval. We evaluate the framework on the NUS-Wide image dataset with approximately 270,000 images represented by BoW features, and demonstrate its advantage over existing method."

The standard local binary pattern (LBP) collects the sign edge (binary code) information between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in an image. Further, the concept of LBP is extended to local maximum edge binary pattern (LMEBP) which collects the sign code (binary code) using the magnitude edges. These magnitude edges are collected based on the maximum edges between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in an image. In this paper, we propose a new feature descriptor, octal code which is coded based on the maximum edge positions (MEP) on Gabor responses. Specially, each pixel of every Gabor response gains eight edges based on the relationship between the referenced pixel and its neighbors. LGMEPOP utilizes the first three dominant (maximum) edge positions in an octal code generation. Then, these three maximum edge positions are encoded into three-eight octal numbers to produce the LGMEPOP. Further, the LGMEPOP is classified into two categories which are named as sign maximum edge position octal pattern (SMEPOP) and magnitude maximum edge position octal pattern (MMEPOP). The SMEPOP and MMEPOP are coded based on the sign and magnitudes of dominant edges respectively. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two benchmark databases. The results after being investigated show a significant improvement as compared to other existing methods (LBP and LBP variants) in terms of average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) on Corel-5000 and Corel-10000 databases."

In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donn\u00e9es) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40\u00b0 incidence angle, over the 2013\u20132014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against in situ soil moisture measurements from &gt; 400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The in situ observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with in situ observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the in situ observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and in situ measurements is best (R &gt; 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R = 0.51 and R = 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets."

Second, each scrambled component is encrypted into a real-valued function with stationary white noise distribution in the iterative amplitude-phase retrieval process in the gyrator transform domain, and then three obtained functions are considered as red, green and blue channels to form the color ciphertext image. Obviously, the ciphertext image is real-valued function and more convenient for storing and transmitting. In the encryption and decryption processes, the chaotic random phase mask generated based on logistic map is employed as the phase key, which means that only the initial values are used as private key and the cryptosystem has high convenience on key management. Meanwhile, the security of the cryptosystem is enhanced greatly because of high sensitivity of the private keys. Simulation results are presented to prove the security and robustness of the proposed scheme."

However, most approaches focus on feature extraction from 2D images while ignoring the spatial information of the 3D model. In order to improve the effectiveness of view-based methods on 3D model retrieval, this paper proposes a novel method for characteristic view extraction and similarity measurement. First, the graph clustering method is used for view grouping and the random-walk algorithm is applied to adaptively update the weight of each view. The spatial information of the 3D object is utilized to construct a view-graph model, thus enabling each characteristic view to represent the discriminative visual feature in terms of specific spatial context. Next, by considering the view set as a graph model, the similarity measurement of two models can be converted into a graph matching problem. This problem is solved by mathematically formulating it as a Rayleigh quotient maximization with affinity constraints for similarity measurement. Extensive comparison experiments were conducted on the popular ETH, NTU, PSB, and MV-RED 3D model datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

When the relative clause verb was singular, forcing attachment to whichever of the nouns was also singular, the presence of a nearby plural attractor noun created greater interference in the process of retrieving the verb's subject from the memory representation of the sentence so far, revealed by an increased frontal negativity when the attractor noun was plural compared to when it was singular. Crucially, attraction effects did not interact with attachment type. The data suggest that plural attraction effects may arise from retrieval interference in grammatical sentences. The data also suggest that interference from plural attractor nouns in agreement processing is just another instance of the retrieval interference effects that arise whenever it becomes necessary to search the memory representation of a sentence so far to form dependency relationships among the words in the sentence."

        "abstract": "Forthcoming superspectral satellite missions dedicated to land monitoring, as well as planned imaging spectrometers, will unleash an unprecedented data stream. The processing requirements for such large data streams involve processing techniques enabling the spatio-temporally explicit quantification of vegetation properties. Typically retrieval must be accurate, robust and fast. Hence, there is a strict requirement to identify next-generation bio-geophysical variable retrieval algorithms which can be molded into an operational processing chain. This paper offers a review of state-of-the-art retrieval methods for quantitative terrestrial bio-geophysical variable extraction using optical remote sensing imagery. We can categorize these methods into (1) parametric regression, (2) non-parametric regression, (3) physically-based and (4) hybrid methods. Hybrid methods combine generic capabilities of physically-based methods with flexible and computationally efficient methods, typically non-parametric regression methods. A review of the theoretical basis of all these methods is given first and followed by published applications. This paper focusses on: (1) retrievability of bio-geophysical variables, (2) ability to generate multiple outputs, (3) possibilities for model transparency description, (4) mapping speed, and (5) possibilities for uncertainty retrieval. Finally, the prospects of implementing these methods into future processing chains for operational retrieval of vegetation properties are presented and discussed."

The effectiveness of the image retrieval is improved significantly by combination of luminance texture and chroma texture with a lower-dimensional vector.

We compare three approaches to similarity-based birdcall retrieval using spectral ridge features and two kinds of gradient features, structure tensor and the histogram of oriented gradients. The retrieval accuracy of our spectral ridge method is 94% compared to 82% for the structure tensor method and 90% for the histogram of gradients method.

To solve these problems, we propose a novel image descriptor, called Global Correlation Descriptor (GCD), to extract color and texture feature respectively so that these features have the same effect in CBIR. In addition, we propose Global Correlation Vector (GCV) and Directional Global Correlation Vector (DGCV) which can integrate the advantages of histogram statistics and SEC to characterize color and texture features respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that GCD is more robust and discriminative than other image descriptors in CBIR."

Albeit successful, such choices introduce too much invariance because they do not guarantee that the patches are rotated or translated consistently. In this paper, we propose a geometric-aware aggregation strategy, which jointly encodes the local descriptors together with their patch dominant angle or location. The geometric attributes are encoded in a continuous manner by leveraging explicit feature maps. Our technique is compatible with generic match kernel formulation and can be employed along with several popular encoding methods, in particular Bag-of-Words, VLAD and the Fisher vector. The method is further combined with an efficient monomial embedding to provide a codebook-free method aggregating local descriptors into a single vector representation. Invariance is achieved by efficient similarity estimation of multiple rotations or translations, offered by a simple trigonometric polynomial. This strategy is effective for image search, as shown by experiments performed on standard benchmarks for image and particular object retrieval, namely Holidays and Oxford buildings."

Then, we improve the retrieval results by active learning from the user\u05f3s relevance feedback using ACSP. Since ACSP is very effective in propagating the user\u05f3s interactive information of constraints by employing a kernel learning strategy, it successfully learns the correlation between low-level image features and high-level semantics from the ROI and relevance feedbacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably improves the image retrieval performance by ACSP-based constraint propagation in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."

The time and accuracy trade-offs for each of these methods are demonstrated on three different image data sets. Similarity of images is obtained either by a feature-based similarity measure using four MPEG-7 low-level descriptors or by a whole image-based similarity measure. The effect of these similarity measurement techniques on the retrieval process is also evaluated through the performance tests performed on several data sets. We show that using low-level features of images in the similarity measurement function results in significantly better accuracy and time performance compared to the whole-image based approach. Moreover, an optimization of feature contributions to the distance measure for feature-based approach can identify the most relevant features and is necessary to obtain maximum accuracy. We further show that multidimensional scaling can achieve comparable accuracy, while speeding-up the query times significantly by allowing the use of spatial access methods."

The characteristics were analyzed based on remote sensing reflectance, and an automatic cluster two-step method was applied for water classification. The inland waters could be clustered into three types, which we labeled water types I, II and III. From water types I to III, the effect of the phytoplankton on the optical characteristics gradually decreased. Four chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms for Case II water, a two-band, three-band, four-band and SCI (Synthetic Chlorophyll Index) algorithm were evaluated for three water types based on the MERIS bands. Different MERIS bands were used for the three water types in each of the four algorithms. The four algorithms had different levels of retrieval accuracy for each water type, and no single algorithm could be successfully applied to all water types. For water types I and III, the three-band algorithm performed the best, while the four-band algorithm had the highest retrieval accuracy for water type II. However, the three-band algorithm is preferable to the two-band algorithm for turbid eutrophic inland waters. The SCI algorithm is recommended for highly turbid water with a higher concentration of total suspended solids. Our research indicates that the chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval by remote sensing for optically contrasted inland water requires a specific algorithm that is based on the optical characteristics of inland water bodies to obtain higher estimation accuracy."

First, an enlarged image constituted with two plaintext images is scrambled by using the first two sequences, and then separated into two new interim images. Second, one interim image is converted to the private phase key with the help of the third sequence, which is modulated by a random phase key generated based on logistic map. Based on this private phase key, another interim image is converted to the ciphertext with white noise distribution in the Yang-Gu amplitude-phase retrieval process. In the process of encryption and decryption, the images both in spatial domain and gyrator domain are nonlinear and disorder by using high dimension chaotic system. Moreover, the ciphertext image is only a real-valued function which is more convenient for storing and transmitting, and the security of the proposed encryption scheme is enhanced greatly because of high sensitivity of initial values of Chen system and rotation angle of gyrator transform. Extensive cryptanalysis and simulation results have demonstrated the security, validity and feasibility of the propose encryption scheme."

In each of three experiments, selective retrieval by the speaker impaired recall of the listener when access to the encoding context was maintained, but it improved recall of the listener when context access was impaired. The results suggest the existence of two faces of selective memory retrieval in social groups, with a detrimental face when the encoding context is still active at retrieval and a beneficial face when it is not.

With the increase in modern malicious technologies, confidential data are exposed at a greater risk during data communication. For secured communication, recent technologies and the Internet have introduced steganography, a new way to hide data. Steganography is the growing practice of concealing data in multimedia files for secure data transfer. Nowadays, videos are more commonly chosen as cover media than other multimedia files because of the moving sequence of images and audio files. Despite its popularity, video steganography faces a significant challenge, which is a lack of a fast retrieval system of the hidden data. This study proposes a novel video steganography technique in which an enhanced hidden Markov model (EHMM) is employed to improve the speed of retrieving hidden data. EHMM mathematical formulations are used to enhance the speed of embedding and extracting secret data. The data embedding and retrieving operations were performed using the conditional states and the state transition dynamics between the video frames. The proposed EHMM is extensively evaluated using three benchmark functions, and experimental evaluations are conducted to test the speed of data retrieval using differently sized cover-videos. Results indicate that the proposed EHMM yields better results by reducing the data hiding time by 3\u201350%, improving the data retrieval rate by 22\u201377% with a minimum computational cost of 20\u201391%, and improving the security by 4\u201377% compared with state-of-the-art methods."

Due to technological advancements in CAD industry, the volume of CAD documents has been increased dramatically in the database of construction organizations. Traditional retrieval methods relied on textual naming and indexing schemes that require the designers (engineers and architects) to memorize in details the meta-information used to characterize the drawings. Such approaches easily overwhelmed the users' memory capability and thus caused low reusability of CAD documents. In this paper, a content-based text mining technique is adopted to extract the textual content of a CAD document into a characteristic document (CD), which can be retrieved with similarity matching using a Vector Space Model (VSM), so that the automated and expedited retrievals of CAD documents from vast CAD databases become possible. A prototype system, namely Content-based CAD document Retrieval System (CCRS), is developed to implement the proposed method. After preliminary testing with a CAD database with 2094 Chinese annotated CAD drawings collected from two real-world construction projects and a public engineering drawing database, the proposed CCRS is proven to retrieve all relevant CAD documents with relatively high precision when appropriate query is specified. Finally, three search strategies are recommended for the users to narrow down search scope while a target CAD document is desired. It is concluded that the proposed content-based text mining approach provides a promising solution to improve the current difficulty encountered in retrieval and reusability of vast CAD documents for the construction industry."

Recent research has motivated a model of processing that exploits a cue-based retrieval mechanism in content-addressable memory (e.g. Lewis, Vasishth, &amp; Van Dyke, 2006) in which item-to-item syntactic relations such as c-command are difficult to use as retrieval cues. As such, the c-command constraints of formal grammars are predicted to be poorly implemented by the retrieval mechanism. We tested whether memory access mechanisms are able to exploit relational information by investigating the processing of bound variable pronouns, a form of anaphoric dependency that imposes a c-command restriction on antecedent-pronoun relations. A quantificational NP (QP, e.g., no janitor) must c-command a pronoun in order to bind it. We contrasted the retrieval of QPs with the retrieval of referential NPs (e.g. the janitor), which can co-refer with a pronoun in the absence of c-command. In three off-line judgment studies and two eye-tracking studies, we show that referential NPs are easily accessed as antecedents, irrespective of whether they c-command the pronoun, but that quantificational NPs are accessed as antecedents only when they c-command the pronoun. These results are unexpected under theories that hold that retrieval exclusively uses a limited set of content features as retrieval cues. Our results suggest either that memory access mechanisms can make use of relational information as a guide for retrieval, or that the set of features that is used to encode syntactic relations in memory must be enriched."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for scientific workflow retrieval with cost constraints. We present a graph representation model called Cost Constrained Graph (CCG) for representing scientific workflows with cost constraints. A distance measure is defined for accurate workflow retrieval. The CCGs representing candidate workflows can be ranked by comparing the similarity among them. We also theoretically prove that this measure satisfies all the four properties of distance. Furthermore, we develop a prototype system for editing, assignment of weights, and automatic similarity computation of workflows. At last, the related experiments are made to demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of workflow retrieval based on our approach."

Twin support vector machines (TWSVM) formulation deals with finding non-parallel plane classifier which is obtained by solving two related Quadratic Programming Problems (QPPs). The proposed TDS-TWSVM classifier is an extension of TWSVM so as to handle multi-class data and is more efficient in terms of training and testing time of classifiers. For a K-class problem, a balanced ternary structure requires \u2308 log 3 K \u2309 comparisons for evaluating a test sample. The experimental results depict that TDS-TWSVM outperforms One-Against-All TWSVM (OAA-TWSVM) and binary tree-based TWSVM (TB-TWSVM) in terms of classification accuracy. We have shown the efficacy of the proposed algorithm via image classification and further for image retrieval. Experiments are performed on a varied range of benchmark image databases with 5-fold cross validation."

        "abstract": "Naming and word-retrieval deficits, which are common characteristics of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), differentially affect production across word classes (e.g., nouns, verbs) in some patients. Individuals with the agrammatic variant (PPA-G) often show greater difficulty producing verbs whereas those with the semantic variant (PPA-S) show greater noun deficits and those with logopenic PPA (PPA-L) evince no clear-cut differences in production of the two word classes. To determine the source of these production patterns, the present study examined word-finding pauses as conditioned by lexical variables (i.e., word class, frequency, length) in narrative speech samples of individuals with PPA-S (n=12), PPA-G (n=12), PPA-L (n=11), and cognitively healthy controls (n=12). We also examined the relation between pause distribution and cortical atrophy (i.e., cortical thickness) in nine left hemisphere regions of interest (ROIs) linked to word production. Results showed higher overall pause rates for PPA compared to unimpaired controls; however, greater naming severity was not associated with increased pause rate. Across all groups, more pauses were produced before lower vs. higher frequency words, with no independent effects of word length after controlling for frequency. With regard to word class, the PPA-L group showed a higher rate of pauses prior to production of nouns compared to verbs, consistent with noun-retrieval deficits arising at the lemma level of word production. Those with PPA-G and PPA-S, like controls, produced similar pause rates across word classes; however, lexical simplification (i.e., production of higher-frequency and/or shorter words) was evident in the more-impaired word class: nouns for PPA-S and verbs for PPA-G. These patterns are consistent with conceptual and/or lemma-level impairments for PPA-S, predominantly affecting objects/nouns, and a lemma-level verb-retrieval deficit for PPA-G, with a concomitant impairment in phonological encoding and articulation affecting overall pause rates. The greater tendency to pause before nouns was correlated with atrophy in the left precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, whereas the greater tendency to pause before less frequent and longer words was associated with atrophy in left precentral and inferior parietal regions."

Regions implicated in cognitive control during associative memory include the dorsal prefrontal (dPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Here we investigated the relative degrees of network-related interactions originating in the dPFC and dACC during oscillating phases of associative memory: encoding and cued retrieval. Volunteers completed an established object-location associative memory paradigm during fMRI. Psychophysiological interactions modeled modulatory network interactions from the dPFC and dACC during memory encoding and retrieval. Results were evaluated in second level analyses of variance with seed region and memory process as factors. Each seed exerted differentiable modulatory effects during encoding and retrieval. The dACC exhibited greater modulation (than the dPFC) on the fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus during encoding, while the dPFC exhibited greater modulation (than the dACC) on the fusiform, hippocampus, dPFC and basal ganglia. During retrieval, the dPFC exhibited greater modulation (than the dACC) on the parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, superior parietal lobule, and dPFC. The most notable finding was a seed by process interaction indicating that the dACC and the dPFC exerted complementary modulatory control on the hippocampus during each of the associative memory processes. These results provide evidence for differentiable, yet complementary, control-related modulation by the dACC and dPFC, while establishing the primacy of dPFC in exerting network control during both associative memory phases. Our approach and findings are relevant for understanding basic processes in human memory and psychiatric disorders that impact associative memory-related networks."

This method, which is based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique, was used to exploit narrow spectral structures resulting from the filling-in of the Fraunhofer Fe I line, which originates from fluorescence. The reference spectra for chlorophyll fluorescence were calculated by the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere radiative transfer model SCIATRAN. We compared our results on marine chlorophyll fluorescence observations with the MODIS Terra normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH) product for the average of years 2003\u20132011 and year 2009. Our method also enables the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence above land vegetation scenes. The results for the fluorescence observed above terrestrial vegetation for July and December 2009 were compared to MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The comparisons show good spatial agreement between different retrievals providing evidence for the good performance of our algorithm. The method presented is generic and can be applied to other hyperspectral instruments in the future. Having established the retrieval technique, extensive studies of chlorophyll fluorescence will improve global knowledge on physiology and photosynthetic efficiency, in both the marine and terrestrial realms, and its dependence on environmental factors."

        "abstract": "The importance of maternal care on offspring development has received considerable attention, although more recently, researchers have begun to focus on the significance of paternal contributions. In the monogamous and bi-parental California mouse, fathers provide high levels of care, and therefore serve as a model system for studying paternal effects on behavior and underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms. Paternal retrievals in this species influence long term changes in brain (expression of arginine vasopressin\u2014AVP) and behavior (aggression and parenting) in adult male offspring. Further, paternal retrievals induce a transient increase in testosterone (T) in male offspring, which is thought to mediate the relationship between paternal retrievals and AVP expression. Although the father\u2013son relationship has been well characterized, few studies have examined father\u2013daughter interactions. In California mice, paternal retrievals increase aggression in female offspring. Although T has been implicated in the regulation of female aggression, it remains unclear whether T may underlie long-term changes in female offspring aggression in response to paternal retrievals. In the current study, we examined the influence of paternal retrievals on T in both male and female offspring. Retrievals were manipulated experimentally by displacement of the pup and trunk blood was collected from retrieved, non-retrieved, and non-manipulated (baseline) pups. We found that fathers expressed similar levels of retrievals towards sons and daughters, and that T levels were elevated in retrieved, as compared to non-retrieved offspring. Similar to what has been previously described in male offspring and replicated here, female offspring that were retrieved had higher T levels than non-retrieved females. Neither females nor males experienced a change in corticosterone levels in response to retrievals suggesting offspring do not mount a stress response to paternal care. Therefore, our data suggest that paternal retrievals may serve similar functions in shaping adult behavior in both male and female offspring via modulation of hormone levels."

To search and retrieve the expected images from the database a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system is highly demanded. CBIR extracts features of a query image and try to match them with extracted features from images in the database. This paper introduces two novel methods as image descriptors. The basis of the proposed methods is built upon scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. After extracting image features using SIFT, k-means clustering is applied on feature matrix extracted by SIFT, and then two new kinds of dimensionality reductions are applied to make SIFT features more efficient and realistic for image retrieval problem. Using the proposed strategies we cannot only take the advantage of SIFT features but also we can highly decrease the memory storage used by SIFT features. As well as in order to compare images we do not need to run the time-consuming matching algorithm of SIFT. Finally, proposed methods are compared with two popular methods namely, color auto-correlogram and wavelet transform. As a result, our proposed retrieval system is fast and accurate and it can efficiently manage large databases. Experimental results on two popular databases, Caltech 101 (with 9144 images) and Li database (with 2360) images, show the superiority and efficiency of the proposed methods."

The relevance of the retrieved images is further improved by matching their texture and shape features respectively. This eliminates the need of fusion and normalization techniques, which are commonly used to calculate final similarity scores. This reduces the computation time and increases the overall accuracy of the system. Moreover, in this technique, global and region features are combined to obtain better retrieval accuracy.

Application of such artificial intelligence can be used to perform automatic document retrieval and interpretation by a robot through query. So, it is necessary to extract the key information from the document based on the query to produce the desired feedback. For this purpose, in this paper we propose a system for automatic date field extraction from multi-lingual (English, Devnagari and Bangla scripts) handwritten documents. The date is a key piece of information, which can be used in various robotic applications such as date-wise document indexing/retrieval. In order to design the system, first the script of the document is identified, and based on the identified script, word components of each text line are classified into month and non-month classes using word-level feature extraction and classification. Next, non-month words are segmented into individual components and labelled into one of text, digit, punctuation or contraction categories. Subsequently, the date patterns are searched using the labelled components. Both numeric and semi-numeric regular expressions have been used for date part extraction. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and profile feature-based approaches are used for classification of month/non-month words. Other date components such as numerals and punctuation marks are recognised using a gradient-based feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are performed on English, Devnagari and Bangla document datasets and the encouraging results obtained from the system indicate the effectiveness of the proposed system."

Since the original 2GPD is of high dimension and redundant, a semi-supervised feature selection algorithm derived from Laplacian Score is then adopted to select the most discriminative feature component of 2GPD as feature representation, and we call it as selected 2GPD.

Due to the super-quadratic computational complexity, canonical forms can only be computed for low-resolution meshes. We suggest a linear time complexity method for computing a canonical form, using Euclidean distances between pairs of a small subset of vertices. This approach has comparable retrieval accuracy but lower time complexity than using global geodesic distances, allowing it to be used on higher resolution meshes, or for more meshes to be considered within a time budget."

Data gaps and spatial and temporal inconsistencies exist in most of the existing global LAI products derived from single-satellite data because of their limited information content. Furthermore, the accuracy of current LAI products may not meet the requirements of certain applications. Therefore, LAI retrieval from multiple satellite data is becoming popular. An existing LAI inversion scheme using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique is further extended in this study to integrate temporal, spectral, and angular information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data. The recursive update of LAI climatology with the retrieved LAI and the coupling of a canopy radiative-transfer model and a dynamic process model using the EnKF technique can fill in missing data and produce a consistent accurate time-series LAI product. During each iteration, we defined a 5 \u2217 1 sliding window and compared the RMSEs in the selected window to determine the minimum. Validation results at six sites demonstrate that the combination of temporal information from multiple sensors, spectral information provided by red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and angular information from MISR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data can provide a more accurate estimate of LAI than previously available."

The texture information is encoded with structuring patterns generated from the locally structured elements chosen as a basis. Color and textural features are fused together to construct the inherently rotation and scale-invariant hybrid image descriptor (RSHD). This fusion is carried out by extracting textural cues over each shade independently.

However, in many cases like the optical microscopy, the imaging systems often involve extended and polychromatic sources for which the effect of the partial coherence is not negligible. In this work, we present a phase-space formulation for the TIE for analyzing phase retrieval under partially coherent illumination. The conventional TIE is reformulated in the joint space-spatial frequency domain using Wigner distribution functions. The phase-space formulation clarifies the physical meaning of the phase of partially coherent fields, and enables explicit account of partial coherence effects on phase retrieval. The correspondence between the Wigner distribution function and the light field in geometric optics limit further enables TIE to become a simple yet effective approach to realize high-resolution light field imaging for slowly varying phase specimens, in a purely computational way."

Thus, many techniques and approaches for CBIR were developed in literature. The CBIR approach works on the visual features of the image rather than a descriptive text. Therefore, it provides more effective and efficient retrieval. On the other hand, PCNN has proved its efficiency as an image processing tool for various tasks such as image segmentation and recognition, feature extraction, edge and object detection. This article introduces a technique for content-based image classification and retrieval using PCNN. The proposed technique uses an optimized Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) to extract the visual features of the image in a form of a numeric vector called image signature. An optimization mechanism was applied to the PCNN parameters in order to improve the signature quality. Thus improving the classification and retrieval results. Additionally, it employs the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm for classification and matching. By applying classification before retrieval, the number of images in the search space is optimized to include one category instead of multiple categories. Moreover, we developed a CBIR prototype to validate our technique. The results show that our technique can retrieve and classify images efficiently. Furthermore, we evaluated our prototype against one of the widely used techniques and it was proven that the proposed technique can enhance the search results and improve the accuracy by 3.5%."

        "abstract": "Content-based 3D object retrieval has wide applications in various domains, ranging from virtual reality to computer aided design and entertainment. With the rapid development of digitizing technologies, different views of 3D objects are captured, which requires for effective and efficient view-based 3D object retrieval (V3DOR) techniques. As each object is represented by a set of multiple views, V3DOR becomes a group matching problem. Most of state-of-the-art V3DOR methods use one single feature to describe a 3D object, which is often insufficient. In this paper, we propose a feature fusion method via multi-modal graph learning for view-based 3D object retrieval. Firstly, different visual features, including 2D Zernike moments, 2D Fourier descriptor and 2D Krawtchouk moments, are extracted to describe each view of a 3D object. Then the Hausdorff distance is computed to measure the similarity between two 3D objects with multiple views. Finally we construct multiple graphs based on different features and learn the optimized weights of each graph automatically for feature fusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ETH-80 dataset and the National Taiwan University 3D model dataset. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."

We consider 29 power plants in the USA which have large NOx plumes that do not overlap with other sources and which have emissions data from the Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). This enables us to identify constraints required by the methods, such as which wind data to use and how to calculate background values. We found that the lifetimes estimated by the methods are too short to be representative of the chemical lifetime. Instead, we introduce a separate lifetime parameter to account for the discrepancy between estimates using real data and those that theory would predict. In terms of emissions, the EMG method required averages from multiple years to give accurate results, whereas the box model method gave accurate results for individual ozone seasons."

        "abstract": "Recently, the bag-of-features (BoF) representation has attracted substantial interest in large scale image retrieval. In BoF representation, images are treated as collections of local invariant descriptors. A visual codebook is constructed by quantizing the local descriptors into clusters, whose centers are called codewords. Then each image could be represented by the frequency histogram over the codebook, and existing text retrieval techniques such as inverted indexing could be applied to image retrieval. It has been recognized that the quality of the codebook is critical to the performance of BoF-based image retrieval systems, and codeword selection is therefore a fundamental problem. Many of the existing approaches for codeword selection make use of the label information of the images. However, collecting the labels of a large amount of images is very expensive. In this paper, we investigate the problem of codeword selection in the absence of labels. Inspired from the techniques of statistical design, we propose two novel unsupervised learning algorithms to select the codewords for an image retrieval system. Specifically, we assume that the relationship between the relevance score and the BoF representation of an image could be expressed by a linear regression model, and select the codewords which can improve the regression model the most. In other words, if the selected codewords are used to train the regression model, the expected prediction error can be minimized. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods."

Secondly, an approach to extract and represent semantic information for heterogeneous multimedia documents is proposed. Thirdly, a NoSQL-based approach to semantic storage, in which multimedia can be parallel processed in distributed nodes is provided. Finally, a MapReduce-based retrieval algorithm is presented and a user feedback supported scheme to achieve high retrieval precision and good user experience is designed.

        "abstract": "The land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) is a methodology that retrieves soil moisture from low frequency dual polarized microwave measurements and has been extensively tested on C-, X- and Ku-band frequencies. Its performance on L-band is tested here by using observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. These observations have potential advantages compared to higher frequencies: a low sensitivity to cloud and vegetation contamination, an increased thermal sampling depth and a greater sensitivity to soil moisture fluctuations. These features make it desirable to add SMOS-derived soil moisture retrievals to the existing European Space Agency (ESA) long-term climatological soil moisture data record, to be harmonized with other passive microwave soil moisture estimates from the LPRM. For multi-channel observations, LPRM infers the effective soil temperature (Teff) from higher frequency channels. This is not possible for a single channel mission like SMOS and therefore two alternative sources for Teff were tested: (1) MERRA-Land and (2) ECMWF numerical weather prediction systems, respectively. SMOS measures brightness temperature at a range of incidence angles, different incidence angle bins (45\u00b0, 52.5\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) were tested for both ascending and descending swaths. Three LPRM algorithm parameters were optimized to match remotely sensed soil moisture with ground based observations: the single scattering albedo, roughness and polarization mixing factor. The soil moisture retrievals were optimized and evaluated against ground-based data from the Murrumbidgee Soil Moisture Monitoring Network (OzNet) in southeast Australia. The agreement with single-angle SMOS LPRM retrievals was close to the official SMOS L3 product, provided the three parameters were optimized for the OzNet dataset, with linear correlation of 0.70\u20130.75 (0.75\u20130.77 for SMOS L3), root-mean-square error of 0.069\u20130.085 m3 m\u2212 3 (0.084\u20130.106 m3 m\u2212 3 for SMOS L3) and small bias of \u2212 0.02\u20130.01 m3 m\u2212 3 (0.03\u20130.06 m3 m\u2212 3 for SMOS L3). These results suggest that the LPRM can be applied successfully to single-angle SMOS L-band observations, but further testing is required to determine if the same set of parameters can be used in other geographic areas."

One hypothesis is that striatal activity reflects an active evaluation process of the retrieval outcome dependent on the current behavioral goals rather than being a consequence of memory reactivation. We have recently shown that the striatum also correlates with confidence in memory recognition, which could reflect high subjective value ascribed to high certainty decisions. To examine whether striatal activity during memory recognition reflects subjective value indeed, we conducted an fMRI study using a recognition memory paradigm in which the participants rated not only the recognition confidence but also indicated the pleasantness associated with the previous memory retrieval. The results demonstrated a high positive correlation between confidence and pleasantness both on the behavioral and brain activation level particularly in the striatum. As almost all of variance in the striatal confidence signal could be explained by experienced pleasantness, this part of the striatal memory recognition response probably corresponds to greater subjective value of high confidence responses. While perceived oldness was also strongly correlated with striatal activity, this activation pattern was clearly distinct from that associated with confidence and pleasantness and thus could not be explained by higher subjective value to detect \u201cold\u201d items. Together, these results show that at least two independent processes contribute to striatal activation in recognition memory: a more flexible evaluation response dependent on context and goals captured by memory confidence and a potentially retrieval-related response captured by perceived oldness."

This hierarchical representation is featured with level of detail ( L O D ) retaining geometric and topological information which is proved to be efficient in both global and partial retrieval. Our approach is based on the standard for the exchange of product information ( S T E P ) , which is suitable for data exchange between heterogeneous CAD systems.

In addition, several brain regions have been suggested to be involved in the retrieval of spatial memory. In particular, several authors reported a possible role of the ventral portion of the hippocampus together with the thalamus or the striatum in the persistence of this type of memory. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the contribution of different cortical and subcortical brain regions, and neural networks involved in spatial memory retrieval. For this purpose, we used cytochrome c oxidase quantitative histochemistry as a reliable method to measure brain oxidative metabolism. Animals were trained in a hidden platform task and tested for memory retention immediately after the last training session; one week after completing the task, they were also tested in a memory retrieval probe. Results showed that retrieval of the previously learned task was associated with increased levels of oxidative metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, the dorsal and ventral striatum, the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and the dentate gyrus of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The analysis of functional interactions between brain regions suggest that the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus could be involved in spatial memory retrieval. In addition, the results highlight the key role of the extended hippocampal system, thalamus and striatum in this process. Our study agrees with previous ones reporting interactions between the dorsal hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, novel activation patterns of brain networks involving the aforementioned regions were found.

It then expands the queries with keywords that best represent the topic of the query, i.e. expansion keywords accompanied by weights indicating their topical similarity to the query. Finally, semantically related terms are added, using two options: either synonymous terms drawn from WordNet or similar words based on distributed representations in a low-dimensional word embedding space learned using word2vec. To evaluate the system, we introduce a dataset (named AREX for AMI Requests for Explanations) and an evaluation metric based on relevance judgments collected by crowdsourcing. We compare our query expansion approach with other methods, over queries from the AREX dataset, showing the superiority of our method when either manual or automatic transcripts of the AMI Meeting Corpus are used."

        "abstract": "Satellite data are increasingly used to provide observation-based estimates of the effects of aerosols on climate. The Aerosol-cci project, part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI), was designed to provide essential climate variables for aerosols from satellite data. Eight algorithms, developed for the retrieval of aerosol properties using data from AATSR (4), MERIS (3) and POLDER, were evaluated to determine their suitability for climate studies. The primary result from each of these algorithms is the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at several wavelengths, together with the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent (AE) which describes the spectral variation of the AOD for a given wavelength pair. Other aerosol parameters which are possibly retrieved from satellite observations are not considered in this paper. The AOD and AE (AE only for Level 2) were evaluated against independent collocated observations from the ground-based AERONET sun photometer network and against \u201creference\u201d satellite data provided by MODIS and MISR. Tools used for the evaluation were developed for daily products as produced by the retrieval with a spatial resolution of 10 \u00d7 10 km2 (Level 2) and daily or monthly aggregates (Level 3). These tools include statistics for L2 and L3 products compared with AERONET, as well as scoring based on spatial and temporal correlations. In this paper we describe their use in a round robin (RR) evaluation of four months of data, one month for each season in 2008. The amount of data was restricted to only four months because of the large effort made to improve the algorithms, and to evaluate the improvement and current status, before larger data sets will be processed. Evaluation criteria are discussed. Results presented show the current status of the European aerosol algorithms in comparison to both AERONET and MODIS and MISR data. The comparison leads to a preliminary conclusion that the scores are similar, including those for the references, but the coverage of AATSR needs to be enhanced and further improvements are possible for most algorithms. None of the algorithms, including the references, outperforms all others everywhere. AATSR data can be used for the retrieval of AOD and AE over land and ocean. PARASOL and one of the MERIS algorithms have been evaluated over ocean only and both algorithms provide good results."

In this method, termed multiscale arch height (MARCH), hierarchical arch height features at different chord spans are extracted from each contour point to provide a compact, multiscale shape descriptor. Both the global and detailed features of the leaf shape can be effectively captured by the proposed algorithm. MARCH descriptors are compared using a simple L1-norm based dissimilarity measurement providing very fast shape matching. The algorithm has been tested on four publicly available leaf image datasets including the Swedish leaf dataset, the Flavia leaf dataset, the ICL leaf dataset and the scanned subset of the ImageCLEF leaf dataset. The experiments indicate that the proposed method can achieve a higher classification rate and retrieval accuracy than the state-of-the-art benchmarks with a more than 500 times faster retrieval speed. A mobile retrieval system embedding the proposed algorithms has been developed for the real application of leaf image retrieval."

During the encoding phase, subjects were presented with a series of colored pictures. Afterwards, during the retrieval phase, all previously presented items and a sample of new pictures were presented in black, and subjects were asked to indicate whether each item was new or old, and in the latter case to indicate the associated color. cTBS was delivered over PC, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and vertex before the retrieval phase. The data were analyzed in terms of hits, false alarms, source errors and omissions. cTBS over the precuneus, but not over the PPC or the vertex, induced a selective decrease in source memory errors, indicating an improvement in context retrieval. All the other accuracy measurements were unchanged. These findings suggest a direct implication of the precuneus in successful context-dependent retrieval."

Through corresponding changes in re-encoding, the retrieval effect of cortisol might translate into a persistent change of the retrieved memory. We tested whether partial suppression of morning cortisol synthesis by metyrapone, leading to intermediate, circadian nadir-like levels with presumed predominant MR activation, improves retrieval, particularly of emotional memory, and persistently changes the memory. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject cross-over design, 18 men were orally administered metyrapone (1 g) vs. placebo at 4:00 AM to suppress the morning cortisol rise. Retrieval of emotional and neutral texts and pictures (learned 3 days earlier) was assessed 4 h after substance administration and a second time one week later. Metyrapone suppressed endogenous cortisol release to circadian nadir-equivalent levels at the time of retrieval testing. Contrary to our expectations, metyrapone significantly impaired free recall of emotional texts (p &lt; .05), whereas retrieval of neutral texts or pictures remained unaffected. One week later, participants still showed lower memory for emotional texts in the metyrapone than placebo condition (p &lt; .05). Our finding that suppressing morning cortisol to nadir-like concentrations not only impairs acute retrieval, but also persistently weakens emotional memories corroborates the concept that retrieval effects of cortisol produce persistent memory changes, possibly by affecting re-encoding."

Damage on twenty retrieved cobalt\u2013chromium femoral heads was simulated in a validated damage-feature-based finite element model. For each individual retrieval, the anatomic orientation of the femoral head about the femoral neck axis was systematically varied, in 30\u00b0 increments. The PE wear rate differential between the maximum- versus minimum-wear orientations was often sizable, as high as 7-fold. Knowing the correct femoral head anatomic orientation is therefore important when analyzing the effects of femoral head damage on PE liner wear. Surgeons retrieving modular femoral heads should routinely mark the anatomic orientation of those components."

In order to address these issues, in this paper a novel adaptive approach for opinion retrieval is proposed. It combines natural-language co-referencing techniques, features-based linguistic preprocessing and memory-based learning to resolving implicit co-referencing within informal opinion texts by using underlying hierarchies of thread messages. Experiments were conducted to assess the ability of the model to improve opinion retrieval by resolving implicit entities and features, showing the promise of our opinion retrieval approach when compared to state-of-the-art methods using text data from social networks."

Concurrent administration of CORT (3 mg/kg) and 17-\u03b2-estradiol (15 \u03bcg/kg) in both proestrus and estrous phases impaired memory retrieval.

QDE has long been of interest in text retrieval. However, few research works have been conducted in image retrieval. Existing QDE methods in image retrieval mainly explore the statistical characteristics (coherence, specificity, etc.) of the returned images to derive a value for indicating the query difficulty degree. To the best of our knowledge, little research has been done to directly estimate the real search performance, such as average precision. In this paper, we propose a novel query difficulty estimation approach which automatically estimates the average precision of the image search results. Specifically, we first adaptively select a set of query relevant and query irrelevant images for each query via modified pseudo relevance feedback. Then a simple but effective voting scheme and two estimation methods (hard estimation and soft estimation) are proposed to estimate the relevance probability of each image in the search results. Based on the images\u05f3 relevance probabilities, the average precision for each query is derived. The experimental results on two benchmark image search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In order to improve the performance and effectiveness using IEML to track the target candidate model, a new similarity measure is built based on spatial and colour features and a new image retrieval framework for this new environment is proposed. Extensive experiments confirm that compared with the latest developed approaches, such as the generalized Hough transform (GHT) and EM-like tracking methods, our method can provide a much better performance in effectiveness. On the other hand, for the IEML, the new similarity measure model also substantially decreases computational complexity and improves the precision tracking of the target candidate model. Compared with the conventional ROI-based image retrieval methods, the most significant highlight is that the proposed method can directly find the target candidate model in the candidate image without pre-segmentation in advance."

However, a confound in these studies is that along with task type the content of what is to be retrieved has varied.

In the episodic task participants indicated the screen location where words had been shown in a prior study phase (left/right/new); whereas in the perceptual task they indicated the current screen location of the word (top/middle/bottom). Consistent with previous studies the ERPs elicited while participants prepared for episodic retrieval were more positive-going at right-frontal sites than when they prepared for the perceptual task. This index was observed, however, on the first trial after participants had switched tasks, rather than on the second trial, as has been observed previously. Potential reasons for this are discussed, including the critical manipulation of similarity in contents between tasks, as well as the use of a predictable cue sequence."

Operationally, techniques are used to flag contaminated retrievals; however, these techniques are less precise in removing dust-contaminated values. A commonly stated metric of quality for SST daytime retrievals is 0.5 \u00b0C; thus dust contents that produce errors greater than this value should be of concern. Here we report on significant correlation between potential SST error and observed aerosol optical depths (AOD) that was found in the tropical region dominated by Saharan dust. Utilizing a radiative transfer model with variable dust contents and typical vertical distributions, errors greater than the desired 0.5 \u00b0C accuracy are observed for dust AODs as low as 0.05. Errors of over 1 \u00b0C occur with 0.25 AOD. Analysis of the AERONET data from Cape Verde, which includes the Saharan Air Layer off the west coast of Africa, reveals that 90% of the days during the boreal summer are found to have AOD amounts that correspond to error greater than 0.5 \u00b0C. We found that a correction accurate within 0.25 \u00b0C requires a mean accuracy of 0.1 AOD and proper vertical placement of the dust layer within 250 m. While empirical SST retrievals often have some measure of climatological dust contamination built into them, this work shows that typical variability in dust loadings is a non-trivial error source against SST retrieval goals."

To promote this research area, two Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) tracks on large scale comprehensive and sketch-based 3D model retrieval have been organized by us in 2014. Both tracks were based on a unified large-scale benchmark that supports multimodal queries (3D models and sketches). This benchmark contains 13680 sketches and 8987 3D models, divided into 171 distinct classes. It was compiled to be a superset of existing benchmarks and presents a new challenge to retrieval methods as it comprises generic models as well as domain-specific model types. Twelve and six distinct 3D shape retrieval methods have competed with each other in these two contests, respectively. To measure and compare the performance of the participating and other promising Query-by-Model or Query-by-Sketch 3D shape retrieval methods and to solicit state-of-the-art approaches, we perform a more comprehensive comparison of twenty-six (eighteen originally participating algorithms and eight additional state-of-the-art or new) retrieval methods by evaluating them on the common benchmark.

These patches are first obtained by means of stably over-segmenting 3D shape, and then we adopt five representative geometric features including shape diameter function, average geodesic distance, and heat kernel signature, to characterize these low-level patches. A large number of patches collected from shapes in a dataset are encoded into patch words by virtue of locality-constrained sparse coding under the consideration of local smooth sparsity. Input query is compared with 3D models in the dataset through probability distribution of patch words. Experiments reveal that the proposed method achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art methods."

In this paper, we propose a correspondence restricted Boltzmann machine (Corr-RBM) to map the original features of bimodal data, such as image and text in our setting, into a low-dimensional common space, in which the heterogeneous data are comparable. In our Corr-RBM, two RBMs built for image and text, respectively are connected at their individual hidden representation layers by a correlation loss function. A single objective function is constructed to trade off the correlation loss and likelihoods of both modalities. Through the optimization of this objective function, our Corr-RBM is able to capture the correlations between two modalities and learn the representation of each modality simultaneously. Furthermore, we construct two deep neural structures using Corr-RBM as the main building block for the task of cross-modal retrieval. A number of comparison experiments are performed on three public real-world data sets. All of our models show significantly better results than state-of-the-art models in both searching images via text query and vice versa."

Representative views are first selected by clustering and the corresponding weights are provided by considering the relationship among these views. By grouping the views from 3D models, a locality-constrained group sparse coding method is employed to find the reconstruction residual for each query view. The distance between query model and candidate model is taken as the weighted sum of residual. The query model is matched to the model which can best reconstruct the query model.

We first propose a new integration kernel based local descriptor, and then an efficient voting scheme is designed for shape representation. Besides, we also study the commute times as shape distributions, which grasp the spatial shape information globally. Both of them capture shape information from different viewpoints based on the same embedding basis. (2) We then study the typical problem of retrieval optimization. Prior works show poor stability under different similarity windows. To deal with this deficiency, we propose to model the problem as a distance mapping on a graph in spectral manifold space. (3) Usually, for each retrieval input, a list is returned and there may be lots of irrelevant results. We develop an algorithm to filter them out by combining multiple kernels. Finally, three public datasets are employed for performance evaluation and the results show that the studied techniques have contributed a lot in promoting the recognition rate of non-rigid 3D shapes."

However, there has been little research on how to find the similar subparts for manufacturing process reuse. In this paper, a novel subpart retrieval approach of 3D CAD models for manufacturing process reuse is presented. First, coupled machining feature cluster (CMFC) is introduced to represent the 3D CAD model into structured MBD (model-based definition) model taking machining features as the carrier of manufacturing semantics. Then, part layer code and CMFC content code for accelerating subpart retrieval are given to filter out unmatched subparts efficiently. Moreover, a multilevel feature descriptor capturing different levels of information for manufacturing process planning is designed to establish the machining feature similarity assessment model. Finally, the machining feature coupled graph (MFCG) based subpart matching algorithm is presented to calculate the similarity between matched subparts. A prototype system has been developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This system overcomes the semantic gap through optimized iterative learning and also provides a better exploration of solution space. Support vector machine learning automatically updates the weights of preferences for relevant images based on the both relevant and irrelevant feedback images.

We focus in particular on research in which two source dimensions (e.g., color and location of a word stimulus), or features, or context attributes, are encoded and subsequently retrieved. We cover some of the basic empirical outcomes of interest, notably the finding of stochastic dependence among retrieval of source dimensions. Such dependence implies that retrieval of one source dimension is related to the retrievability of the other source dimension. Many research papers have established that stochastic dependence is supported by encoding factors that help bind items to context, and perhaps even context to context. Yet the finding of, and degree of, stochastic dependence at retrieval does not always relate predictably to other manipulations, such as when people are focused on one or the other source dimension in an encoding phase. Moreover, other theoretical proposals target retrieval processes, apart from encoding processes, as producing such dependence. Research that has included retrieval manipulations, such as external cuing of source dimensions at test, suggests that retrieval-specific causes of stochastic dependence have not been established. We also discuss other paradigms that are relevant to the retrieval of multiple object features and whether their retrieval is dependent or independent of one another. Mixed evidence results from this work, with some arguing for relative independence of object features, but others arguing for strong associative relationships among elements that predict somewhat all-or-none retrieval of items and their contexts or features (i.e., dependence). We attempt to integrate these various research paradigms and draw some broad, albeit tentative, conclusions about this collective work. We also suggest areas of research that should be considered as future work in multidimensional source memory."

While it is one of the few important hydrological variables that can be directly observed, the high spatial and temporal variability makes it difficult to measure globally or even regionally. Reliance is therefore placed on land surface models to predict the evolution of soil moisture using low-resolution soil property information or typical values. But to make predictions with the required accuracy, more reliable and detailed soil parameter data are required than those currently available. This paper demonstrates the ability to retrieve soil hydraulic parameters from near-surface measurements, using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) observations disaggregated to 1 km resolution for a demonstration area the size of a single SMOS footprint. The disaggregated soil moisture product was first assessed against in-situ soil moisture observations, before testing the retrieval methodology using the disaggregated soil moisture data for individual soil columns co-located with three long-term monitoring sites in the Murrumbidgee Catchment. The retrieval methodology was then applied to the entire 40 km \u00d7 40 km demonstration area at 5 km spatial resolution. The results suggest that spatially variable soil hydraulic properties exist in the study area, while published soil texture maps show only a single soil type, meaning that a single set of soil hydraulic parameters would normally be used in soil moisture prediction models for this region. Use of a single set of soil hydraulic parameters, rather than the spatially variables ones, was estimated to have an approximate 0.06 m3/m3 impact on the soil moisture prediction."

Compared with the conventional DPC-CT reconstruction algorithms, the proposed method removes the Hilbert imaginary filter and allows for the direct use of absorption-contrast FBP algorithms.

However, in the process of container retrieval, non-productive reshuffling may be required to relocate the containers that are stacked on top of the target container. Container retrieval is directly related to the operational efficiency of terminals. Because the industry has become increasingly competitive, it has become critical to introduce a systematic approach to retrieving containers. In this study, we develop a heuristic that can generate feasible working plans for rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGC) in container yards to minimize the number of container movements while taking the RMGC working time into consideration. The methodology takes into consideration the case that containers are grouped in terms of their retrieval order. Multi-lift RMGC models also are studied. Comprehensive numerical experiments reveal that the method runs faster than other methods published in the literature by several orders of magnitude; additionally, our method is able to solve instances larger than practical use. The number of movements approaches a theoretical lower bound, and the numerical results clearly demonstrate the tradeoff between the number of movements and the working time, and provide useful insights for yard planning."

        "abstract": "Indexing methods have been widely used for fast data retrieval on large scale datasets. When the data are represented by high dimensional vectors, hashing is often used as an efficient solution for approximate similarity search. When a retrieval task does not involve supervised training data, most hashing methods aim at preserving data similarity defined by a distance metric on the feature vectors. Hash codes generated by these approaches normally maintain the Hamming distance of the data in accordance with the similarity function, but ignore the local details of the distribution of data. This objective is not suitable for k-nearest neighbor search since the similarity to the nearest neighbors can vary significantly for different data samples. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive similarity measure which is consistent with k-nearest neighbor search, and prove that it leads to a valid kernel if the original similarity function is a kernel function. Next we propose a method which calculates hash codes using the kernel function. With a low-rank approximation, our hashing framework is more effective than existing methods that preserve similarity over an arbitrary kernel. The proposed similarity function, hashing framework, and their combination demonstrate significant improvement when compared with several alternative state-of-the-art methods."

Therefore, understanding the underlying basis of the effect of immune system activation on neural function could lead to therapies for treating cognitive decline. Although neuroinflammation is widely thought to preferentially impair hippocampus-dependent memory, data on the effects of cytokines on cognition are mixed. One possible explanation for these inconsistent results is that cytokines may disrupt specific neural processes underlying some forms of memory but not others. In an earlier study, we tested the effect of systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on retrieval of hippocampus-dependent context memory and neural circuit function in CA3 and CA1 (Czerniawski and Guzowski, 2014). Paralleling impairment in context discrimination memory, we observed changes in neural circuit function consistent with disrupted pattern separation function. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that acute neuroinflammation selectively disrupts memory retrieval in tasks requiring hippocampal pattern separation processes. Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats given LPS systemically prior to testing exhibited intact performance in tasks that do not require hippocampal pattern separation processes: novel object recognition and spatial memory in the water maze. By contrast, memory retrieval in a task thought to require hippocampal pattern separation, context\u2013object discrimination, was strongly impaired in LPS-treated rats in the absence of any gross effects on exploratory activity or motivation. These data show that LPS administration does not impair memory retrieval in all hippocampus-dependent tasks, and support the hypothesis that acute neuroinflammation impairs context discrimination memory via disruption of pattern separation processes in hippocampus."

Two days later, they were either asked to recall the objects, given a subtle reminder, or were not reminded of the first learning session. Then, participants learned a second list of objects or performed a distractor task. After another two days, retention of List 1 was tested. Although retrieval enhanced List 1 memory, learning a second list impaired memory in all conditions. This shows that testing did not protect memory from RI. While a subtle reminder before List 2 learning caused List 2 items to later intrude into List 1 recall, very few such intrusions were observed in the testing and the no reminder conditions. The findings are discussed in reference to the reconsolidation account and the testing effect literature, and implications for educational practice are outlined."

Here, we approach this question by investigating the nature of trial-by-trial dynamics of selective LTM retrieval, i.e., in how far retrieval in one trial has detrimental or facilitatory effects on selective retrieval in the following trial. Participants first learned associations between retrieval cues and targets, with one cue always being linked to three targets, forming small associative networks. In successive trials, participants had to access either the same or a different target belonging to either the same or a different cue. We found that retrieval times were faster for targets that had already been relevant in the previous trial, with this facilitatory effect being substantially weaker when the associative network changed in which the targets were embedded. Moreover, staying within the same network still had a facilitatory effect even if the target changed, which became evident in a relatively higher memory performance in comparison to a network change. Furthermore, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) showed topographically and temporally dissociable correlates of these effects, suggesting that they result from combined influences of distinct processes that aid memory retrieval when relevant and irrelevant targets change their status from trial to trial. Taken together, the present study provides insight into the different processing stages of memory retrieval when fast switches between retrieval targets are required."

However, the application is limited to global- and regional-scale studies, which may not be applicable for urban areas due to its low spatial resolution. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposed an improved aerosol retrieval algorithm for Landsat images (ImAero-Landsat) at spatial resolution of 30 m. This ImAero-Landsat algorithm has been improved in the following two aspects: (i) it does not require a comprehensive look up table and thus it is more efficient in AOT retrieval; and (ii) it can be operated in both bright and dark surfaces. The derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) images were validated with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements as well as MODIS MOD04 AOT products. Small root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.11 and 0.14 and mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.07 and 0.11 between ImAero-Landsat AOT, with MODIS MOD04 and AERONET products were observed. By correlating with ground based PM10 concentrations, the ImAero-Landsat method outperforms (r2 = 0.32) than MOD04 AOT products (r2 = 0.23). In addition, the accuracy of estimating PM10 can be improved to r2 = 0.55 when the derived AOT was integrated with meteorological parameters. The accuracy is similar to the results derived from AERONET AOT (r2 = 0.62). This study offers a simple and accurate method to investigate aerosol optical thickness at detailed city-scale. Environmental authorities may use the derived methods for deriving aerosol distribution maps and pinpointing the sources of pollutants in urban areas."

In this study, participants engaged in a recognition task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. They viewed neutral titles and indicated whether each title had been presented with an image during the study phase. Neural activity and connectivity during retrieval of titles associated with positive and negative images were compared with age (treated as a continuous variable) included as a regressor of interest. Aging was associated with increased prefrontal activation for retrieval of positive and negative memories, but this pattern was more widespread for negative memories. Aging also was associated with greater negative connectivity between a left hippocampal seed region and multiple regions of prefrontal cortex, but this effect of age occurred during negative retrieval only. These findings demonstrate that age-related changes in prefrontal recruitment and connectivity during retrieval depend on memory valence. The use of a life span approach also emphasized both continuities and discontinuities in recruitment and connectivity across the adult life span, highlighting the insights to be gained from using a full life span sample."

The abnormalities in DNA methylation can occur in various types of cancer and some genetic diseases. The measurement of DNA methylation is therefore important and there is a range of methodologies used to detect DNA methylation. Many methods based on bisulfite treatment appeared with a lack of specificity after recent discoveries of various modifications of methylated cytosine, however there are new treatments developed to overcome this limitation. Immunofluorescence is currently known to be able to specifically detect DNA methylation as it uses different antibodies against 5meC and its derivatives, but it is a semi-quantitative method. Immunofluorescence protocols commonly include fixation of cells followed by permeabilisation, antigen retrieval, and treatments with antibodies. Establishing the strategy for antigen retrieval of immunofluorescence is important to unmask epitopes (i.e. 5meC) from other proteins, and therefore to access the antigen of interest. There are many approaches used for antigen retrieval induced by acid, enzyme and/or heat. The selection of antigen retrieval method can depend on a variety of such antigen-based or cell-based conditions, since the dynamic structure of DNA and chromatin accounts for the complexity of involved proteins to mask the epitope. This review aims to specifically focus on the complexity of in situ detection of DNA methylation by immunofluorescence-based methods using antigen retrieval with the current understanding of DNA methylation mechanism, and suggests conditions for antigenic retrieval of 5meC epitope."

With the wide popularity of somatosensory equipment (Kinect for example), more and more dynamic 3D depth data are shared on the Internet, which results in an urgent need to retrieve these data efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose a generalized strategy for dynamic 3D depth data matching and apply this strategy in action retrieval task. Firstly, an improved 3D shape context descriptor (3DSCD) is proposed to extract features of each static depth frame. Then we employ dynamic time warping (DTW) to measure the temporal similarity between two 3D dynamic depth sequences. Experimental results on our collected dataset consisting of 170 dynamic 3D depth video clips show that the proposed 3DSCD has a rich descriptive power on depth data and that the method using 3DSCD and DTW achieves high matching accuracy. Finally, to address the matching efficiency problem, we utilize the bag of word (BoW) model to quantize the 3DSCD of each static depth frame into visual word packages. So the original feature matching problem is simplified into a two-histogram matching problem. The results demonstrate the matching efficiency of our proposed method, while still maintaining high matching accuracy."

A method integrating these two remotely sensed data sets is presented in this study. Snow depth retrieval is performed using microwave brightness temperature at 19 and 37 GHz from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder (SSMI/S), and visible/infrared surface reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroadiometer (MODIS) products. Microwave brightness temperature provides information about the volume of snow pack, and visible/infrared surface reflectance can indicate snow presence and surface grain size. With these two remote sensing data sets, snow depth is retrieved by a nonlinear data mining technique, the modified sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) regression. The proposed method is tested by using 16,329 records of dry snow measured at 54 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China over an area of 1.6 million km2 from 2000 to 2009. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE and the correlation coefficient of our method are 6.21 cm, 0.64 and 0.87, respectively. These results are better than those obtained using only brightness temperature data (8.80 cm, 0.90 and 0.73), the traditional spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm (15.07 cm, 1.54 and 0.58), a modified Chang algorithm in WESTDC (9.80 cm, 1.00 and 0.62), or the multilayer perceptron classifier of artificial neural networks (ANN) (9.23 cm, 0.94 and 0.72).

They have interesting advantages, the majors of which are a high throughput, efficient use of space and improvement of safety. All the disadvantages of AS/RS are related to economic factors such as high initial investments and difficulty to change layout. This implies the importance of careful design of the AS/RS by taking into account all constraints. The latter may be linked either to the AS/RS dimensions or to products. The evaluation of average travel time that the S/R machine takes to store and retrieve a product is necessary for an optimal design. The present paper is devoted to a particular configuration of AS/RS said flow-rack AS/RS. The flow-rack AS/RS consists of only one deep rack and two machines; the first is used for storing operations and the second for retrieval operations. Our aim is to model mathematically the average travel time of the retrieval machine under random storage. The mathematical model proposed hereunder is certainly function of the physical parameters of the flow-rack AS/RS such as length, width, depth, etc.; but it is also function of the variety of products stored in the system and of their proportions. The mathematical model could be useful for performance evaluation and for design considerations of the flow-rack AS/RS in real world applications. The validation of the model is done by simulation."

In this work, we estimate important design parameters for a newly designed storage/retrieval (SGP-AS/RS) machine based on the specific input details to come up with an optimized design solution. The new system is based on cable- driven parallel manipulator (or wire robot) technology that is similar to a parallel Stewart-Gough platform architecture. For the reliability of such a system, a Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) is carried out to find out how much reliable is this machine as a whole based on the of DIN's EN 60812 standards. This International Standard describes methods for FMEA and helps not only to optimize the machine, but also to achieve a disturbance free operation."

        "abstract": "Selective retrieval is a rather difficult task, and especially so when one attempts to retrieve personal representations such as faces or names. Retrieval of memories under strong competition conditions is pervasive in human memory and some have suggested that inhibitory control is used to overcome interference between competing stimuli. In the present study, we used the retrieval practice paradigm to investigate if competition among personal representations (such as facial features and names) is also resolved by inhibitory mechanisms. This question is theoretically relevant, since personal representations have been said to have a special status on cognition. Moreover, some models of face recognition assume that interference can arise between different representations, but that this interference would be automatically and rapidly solved, with no need for a controlled inhibitory mechanism to act. In two experiments we showed RIF for facial features and familiar names, but only when participants had to actively retrieve some information. This suggests that personal information is subject to mechanisms of inhibitory control, which could help explain everyday life difficulties in processes such as face feature recognition or name retrieval."

Support vector machine (SVM) active learning is one popular and successful technique for relevance feedback in CBIR. Despite the success, for conventional SVM active learning, the users are usually not so patience to label a large number of training instances in the relevance feedback round. To overcome this limitation, a new SVM-based active feedback using ensemble multiple classifiers is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we select the most informative images by using active learning method for user to label, and quickly learn a boundary that separates the images that satisfy the user\u05f3s query concept from the rest of the dataset. Then, a set of moderate accurate one-class SVM classifiers are trained separately by using different sub-features vectors. Finally, we compute the weight vector of component SVM classifiers dynamically by using the parameters for positive and negative samples, and combine the results of the component classifiers to form an output code as a hypothesized solution to the overall image retrieval problem. Experiments on large databases show that the proposed algorithms are significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches."

The proposed motif representation is entirely different from existing motif. The DLMXoRP presents a novel technique for the calculation of motif using 1 \u00d7 3 grids. The proposed motif (1 \u00d7 3) representation is having a flexible structure; hence it can able to extract all directional information. This flexibility is not present in the existing (2 \u00d7 2) motif. Further, the XoR operation is performed on the transformed new motif images which are not present in the literature (local binary patterns (LBP) and motif co-occurrence matrix (MCM)). To elevate the benefits of DLMXoRP, we compare it with the Motif XoR pattern (MXoR) which is calculated by applying the XoR operation on existing transformed motif image. The performance of the proposed method is tested by conducting three experiments on Corel-5000, Corel-10000 and MIT-VisTex databases. The results after investigation show a significant improvement in terms of average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques for image retrieval."

In the proposed retrieval system, each image is segmented and a set of characteristic features is calculated for each region. A weight is assigned to each region according to its perceived saliency. The proposed methodology considers not only the salient regions but also their context in the image. Localized image similarity is evaluated using an optimization method called the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). EMD calculates inter-region distances between images and in our algorithm it considers the local saliency as well. A global image saliency, evaluated in terms of spatially-invariant salient edges, is used as an additional term in the optimization search besides the EMD distance. Experimental results are provided for three different image databases containing a wide variety of semantic categories."

There is indeed a growing availability of images, but unfortunately the traditional metadata-based search systems are unable to properly exploit their visual information content. In this article we introduce a novel CBIR scheme that abstracts each image in the database in terms of statistical features computed using the Multi-scale Geometric Analysis (MGA) of Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT). Noise resilience is one of the main advantages of this feature representation. To improve the retrieval performance and reduce the semantic gap, our system incorporates a Relevance Feedback (RF) mechanism that uses a graph-theoretic approach to rank the images in accordance with the user\u2019s feedback. First, a graph of images is constructed with edges reflecting the similarity of pairs of images with respect to the proposed feature representation. Then, images are ranked at each feedback round in terms of the probability that a random walk on this graph reaches an image tagged as relevant by the user before hitting a non-relevant one. Experimental analyses on three different databases show the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art approaches in particular when the images are corrupted with different types of noise."

Participants named pictures that were presented repeatedly across six cycles, either in semantically related or unrelated sets. Previous research has suggested that selection demands are higher for related sets, especially after repetition, since participants experience competition from the activation of semantic neighbours. In contrast, retrieval demands are greater for unrelated sets in the absence of semantic priming, particularly on the first cycle when the target names have not been previously activated. Therefore, this paradigm can reveal independent effects of (i) retrieval demands (i.e., the ease of accessing picture names from visual input) and (ii) selection/competition. We found that rTMS to LIFG and pMTG produced similar behavioural effects: stimulation of both sites disrupted picture naming performance on early cycles (when participants were less practised at producing the picture names) and for semantically-related sets (when there was the potential for increased competition and yet also facilitation from semantic neighbours). There were no effects of TMS when either retrieval or selection requirements were maximal on their own. The data therefore support the view that both LIFG and pMTG contribute to picture name retrieval, with both sites playing a critical role in mediating the semantic facilitation of naming when retrieval demands are high."

A central component of behavioral updating during reconsolidation using a retrieval\u2013extinction manipulation (Ret + Ext) is the synaptic removal of a calcium-permeable-\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (CP-AMPARs) in the lateral amygdala\u2014a metabotropic GluR1 receptor (mGluR1) dependent mechanism. In the present study, we investigate the effect of Ret + Ext on the expression of molecular markers that could play a role in the reconsolidation process. Specifically, we tested the effects of Ret + Ext on the global expression of zinc-finger 268 protein (Zif268), a marker previously found to be implicated in memory reconsolidation, to confirm its occurrence after retrieval (Ret) and Ret + Ext. We also evaluated the global expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6P), here proposed as a marker of the mGluR1-mediated memory process induced by Ret + Ext. The expression of both markers (zif268, rpS6P) was assessed by immunolocalization in prelimbic cortex (PRL), infralimbic cortex (IL), ventral subdivision of the lateral amygdala (LA) and hippocampus CA1 (CA1) in fear-conditioned rats. Our results showed that retrieval and Ret + Ext, but not extinction alone, increased Zif268 expression in prefrontal cortex and lateral amygdala. Ret + Ext, but not retrieval, retrieval followed by context exposure or extinction alone, increased the expression of rpS6P in prefrontal cortex and LA. In summary, (i) Zif268 increased after retrieval confirming that reconsolidation is engaged in our conditions, (ii) Zif268 increased after Ret + Ext confirming that it does not simply reflect an extinction or reconsolidation disruption (Zif268 level of expression should be lower in both cases) and (iii) rpS6P increased after Ret + Ext, but not after extinction, suggesting, as expected, a potential mGluR1 mediated molecular mechanism specific for Ret + Ext. Together with the Zif268 increase, our results suggest that the Ret + Ext induced memory process is more similar to reconsolidation updating than extinction facilitation."

A number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (TPW) using microwave or optical remote sensing. In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter \u2206 Tb18.7/\u2206 Tb23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity \u2206 \u03b518.7/\u2206 \u03b523.8 and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05\u00b0 \u00d7 0.05\u00b0 using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05\u00b0 \u00d7 0.05\u00b0 gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05\u00b0 \u00d7 0.05\u00b0 gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies."

The ash and SO2 plume abundance maps are computed using the Volcanic Plume Removal (VPR) procedure originally applied to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensors on board the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites. As test cases, two 2011 lava fountain episodes were considered. The set of parameters required by VPR for the Mt. Etna volcano, Volz type particles, and the SEVIRI sensor are presented. Once the parameters have been computed, the VPR approach requires as input only the SEVIRI-TIR radiances of the bands centered at 8.7, 10.8, and 12.0 \u03bcm, together with the plume temperature and altitude. The VPR returns maps of plume particles' effective radius, aerosol optical depth at 550 nm, and columnar abundance of ash and SO2. A new procedure for estimating wind speed and direction is also presented. Since the ash and SO2 abundance maps, and wind speed at the plume altitude are known, it is possible to reconstruct the ash and SO2 fluxes emitted during the eruption through time. The VPR procedure, applied to TIR SEVIRI data, allows for fast and reliable ash and SO2 retrieval with high temporal resolution during both day and night, and is thus suitable for operational use during a volcanic crisis."

However, some user-provided tags of social images are too incomplete and ambiguous to facilitate the social image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization framework to complete the missing tags for social images (tag completion). Within the regularized optimization framework, the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and the holistic visual diversity minimization are used jointly to make the tag-image matrix completed as the relationships of images and tags are represented to a tag-image matrix. The non-negative matrix factorization casts the tag-image matrix into a latent low-rank space and utilizes the semantic relevance of tags to partially complete the insufficient tags. To take the visual content of images into account, the other objective term representing the holistic visual diversity is appended with the NMF to leverage the content-similar images. Moreover, to ensure the proper corrections and sparseness of tag-image matrix, two regularized factors are also included into the optimization framework. Through conducting the experiments on the benchmark image set with the adequate ground truth, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

A within-subject approach was adopted to compare the freezing rates of rats in EC intact and EC inactivated conditions following trace fear conditioning. The EC was inactivated by infusing an AMPA antagonist. The fear conditioning used a combined visual and auditory conditioned stimulus with a foot shock. On week 1 following the conditioning, the rats in the EC intact condition exhibited a freezing rate of 92.4 \u00b1 9.5% in response to the light stimulus compared with a 6.3 \u00b1 7.9% freezing rate in the EC inactivated condition. The freezing rates were 87.0 \u00b1 17.8% and 4.7 \u00b1 6.5% on week 2 in the EC intact and inactivated conditions, respectively. These results indicate that the EC participates in the retrieval of associative memory. Extinction of the fear memory was observed in the EC intact condition, as the mean freezing rate decreased to 62.7 \u00b1 23.0% on week 4 and 41.2 \u00b1 26.4% on week 5. However, the freezing rate increased to 26.8 \u00b1 14.2% on week 4 and 22.3 \u00b1 14.4% on week 5 in the EC inactivated condition. The normalized dependence of fear memory retrieval on the EC was 93.2 \u00b1 8.3% on week 1, and significantly decreased on weeks 4 and 5.

Using retrieval-induced forgetting as a model case, we illustrate this by showing that changing the way that retrieval-induced forgetting is measured to allow greater expression of the benefits of inhibition together with the costs can reduce and even reverse the theoretically predicted correlation between motor and memory inhibition. Specifically, we show that when the final test in a retrieval-induced forgetting procedure employs item-specific cues (i.e., category-plus-stem cued recall and item-recognition) that better isolate the lingering costs of inhibition, better motor response inhibition (faster stop-signal reaction times) predicts greater retrieval-induced forgetting. In striking contrast, when the final test is less well controlled, allowing both the costs and benefits of inhibition to contribute, motor response inhibition has the opposite relationship with retrieval-induced forgetting. These findings underscore the importance of considering the correlated costs and benefits problem when studying individual differences in inhibitory control. More generally, they suggest that a shared inhibition mechanism may underlie people\u2019s ability to control memories and actions."

In Experiment 1, dynamic visual noise led to a reduction in the number of specific memories retrieved in response to both high and low imageability cues, but did not affect retrieval times. In Experiment 2, irrelevant pictures reduced the number of specific memories but only in response to low imageability cues. Irrelevant pictures also increased response times to both high and low imageability cues. The findings are in line with previous work suggesting that disrupting executive resources may impair generative, but not direct, retrieval of autobiographical memories. In contrast, visual distractor tasks appear to impair access to specific autobiographical memories via both the direct and generative retrieval routes, thereby highlighting the potential role of visual imagery in both pathways."

Dimensionality reduction is an effective method to overcome it. In this paper, six commonly-used dimensionality reduction methods are compared and analyzed to examine their respective performance in image retrieval. The six methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA), Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). For comparison, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and color histogram in Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) color space are firstly extracted as image features, meanwhile SIFT feature extraction procedure is optimized to reduce the number of SIFT features. Then, PCA, FLDA, LFDA, ISOMAP, LLE, and LPP are respectively applied to reduce the dimensions of feature vectors, which can be used to generate vocabulary trees. Finally, we can process large-scale image retrieval based on the inverted index built by vocabulary trees. In the experiments, the performance of various dimensionality reduction methods are analyzed comprehensively by comparing the retrieval performance, advantages and disadvantages, computational complexity and time-consuming of image retrieval. Through a series of experiments, we can conclude that dimensionality reduction method of LLE and LPP can effectively reduce computational complexity of image retrieval, while maintaining high retrieval performance."

Although thermal infrared (TIR) satellite sounders are considered to have limited sensitivity to the composition of the near-surface atmosphere, previous studies show that they can provide information on CO close to the ground in case of high thermal contrast. In this work we investigate the capability of IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) to retrieve near-surface CO concentrations, and we quantitatively assess the influence of thermal contrast on such retrievals. We present a 3-part analysis, which relies on both theoretical forward simulations and retrievals on real data, performed for a large range of negative and positive thermal contrast situations. First, we derive theoretically the IASI detection threshold of CO enhancement in the boundary layer, and we assess its dependence on thermal contrast. Then, using the optimal estimation formalism, we quantify the role of thermal contrast on the error budget and information content of near-surface CO retrievals. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is usually accepted, large negative thermal contrast values (ground cooler than air) lead to a better decorrelation between CO concentrations in the low and the high troposphere than large positive thermal contrast (ground warmer than the air). In the last part of the paper we use Mexico City and Barrow as test cases to contrast our theoretical predictions with real retrievals, and to assess the accuracy of IASI surface CO retrievals through comparisons to ground-based in-situ measurements."

Little is known regarding factors that determine the memory content that is subject to this across-episode binding. We tested whether across-episode binding preferentially occurs for memory content that is currently \u201cactive\u201d and identified relevant neural correlates. After studying objects at specific locations on scene backgrounds, subjects performed one of two retrieval tasks for the objects on different scene backgrounds. In an active condition, subjects recalled object locations, whereas subjects merely dragged objects to predetermined locations in a passive condition. Immediately following each object-location retrieval event, a novel face appeared on a blank screen. We hypothesized that the original episode content would be active in memory during face encoding in the active condition, but not in the passive condition (despite seeing the same content in both conditions). A ramification of the active condition would thus be preferential binding of original episode content to novel faces, with no such across-episode binding in the passive condition. Indeed, memory for faces was better when tested on the original background scenes in the active relative to passive condition, indicating that original episode content was bound with the active condition faces, whereas this occurred to a lesser extent for the passive condition faces. Likewise, early-onset negative ERP effects reflected binding of the face to the original episode content in the active but not the passive condition. In contrast, binding in the passive condition occurred only when faces were physically displayed on the original scenes during recognition testing, and a very similar early-onset negative ERP effect signaled binding in this condition. ERP correlates of binding were thus similar for across-episode and within-episode binding (and were distinct from other encoding and retrieval ERP signals in both cases), indicating that active retrieval modulated when binding occurred, not the nature of the binding process per se. These results suggest that active retrieval promotes binding of new information with contents of memory, whereas without active retrieval, these unrelated pieces of information might be bound only when they are physically paired."

Recently, companies and research groups have announced that they have been employing health software frameworks. This paper presents the design, proof-of-concept implementations and experimentation of the Health Surveillance Software Framework (HSSF). The HSSF is a framework that tackles the demand for the recommendation of surveillance information aiming at supporting preventive healthcare strategies. Examples of such strategies are the automatic recommendation of surveillance levels to patients in need of healthcare and the automatic recommendation of scientific literature that elucidates epigenetic problems related to patients. HSSF was created from two systems we developed in our previous work on health surveillance systems: the Automatic-SL and CISS systems. The Automatic-SL system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making decisions and in identifying children with developmental problems. The CISS service associates genetic and epigenetic risk factors related to chronic diseases with patient\u2019s clinical records. Towards evaluating the HSSF framework, two new systems, CISS+ and CISS-SW, were created by means of abstractions and instantiations of the framework (design and code). We show that HSSF supported the development of the two new systems given that they both recommend scientific papers using medical records as queries even though they exploit different computational technologies. In an experiment using simulated patients\u2019 medical records, we show that CISS, CISS+, and CISS-SW systems recommended more closely related and somewhat related documents than Google, Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering recall and precision measures, CISS+ surpasses CISS-SW in terms of precision."

Short term learning (STL) and long term learning (LTL) are two learning methods of relevance feedback scheme. This paper presents a long term learning method in CBIR systems adopting case based reasoning (CBR) which is called Case-based LTL (CB-LTL). The method has two stages of learning and reasoning. In the learning stage, information extracted from retrieval sessions is saved as cases and in the reasoning stage, information of cases is utilized to improve the results of the retrieval sessions. The main components of CB-LTL method are \u2018key of query\u2019 which represents the desire of the user, a \u2018trigger function\u2019 which is used to find a similar case with a query, and \u2018semantic frame\u2019 which is a structure for saving cases. In the proposed method, cases are recorded in the case knowledge base using both low level and high level features. The information of the relevance feedback and short term learning are employed as high level features. In this paper, the general approach of CB-LTL is produced and an example of the method is implemented in a CBIR system with the similarity refinement based STL. To evaluate the proposed method, a comparative study with the \u201cvirtual feature based\u201d LTL method is performed based on the Corel image dataset. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Case-based LTL method empirically."

Although autobiographical memories are typically encoded from the visual perspective of our own eyes they can be retrieved from the perspective of an observer looking at our self. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of shifting visual perspective during long-term memory retrieval and its influence on online and subsequent memories using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants generated specific autobiographical memories from the last five years and rated their visual perspective. In a separate fMRI session, they were asked to retrieve the memories across three repetitions while maintaining the same visual perspective as their initial rating or by shifting to an alternative perspective. Visual perspective shifting during autobiographical memory retrieval was supported by a linear decrease in neural recruitment across repetitions in the posterior parietal cortices. Additional analyses revealed that the precuneus, in particular, contributed to both online and subsequent changes in the phenomenology of memories. Our findings show that flexibly shifting egocentric perspective during autobiographical memory retrieval is supported by the precuneus, and suggest that this manipulation of mental imagery during retrieval has consequences for how memories are retrieved and later remembered."

Second, near-duplicate image clustering is used to group large-scale web images into a set of clusters of near-duplicate images according to their visual similarities. The near-duplicate web images in the same cluster share similar semantics and are simultaneously associated with a same or similar set of auxiliary text terms or phrases which co-occur frequently in the relevant text blocks, thus performing near-duplicate image clustering can significantly reduce the uncertainty on the relatedness between the semantics of web images and their auxiliary text terms or phrases. Finally, random walk is performed over a phrase correlation network to achieve more precise image\u2013text alignment by refining the relevance scores between the web images and their auxiliary text terms or phrases. Our experiments on algorithm evaluation have achieved very positive results on large-scale cross-media web pages."

In this paper, we investigate a novel application of leveraging fMRI techniques to video clustering and retrieval. In the proposed work, we successfully integrate semantic human-centric features derived from natural stimulus fMRI data and low-level visual-audio features to facilitate video clustering and retrieval, which is a significant innovation compared to the previous works relying on either fMRI-derived features or low-level visual-audio features. Our system consists of several algorithmic modules. First, fMRI data when the subjects are watching video shot samples are acquired. Then a newly developed brain networks localization system is employed to locate the cortical regions of interests (ROIs) for each individual subject. The functional interactions computed by wavelet transform coherence are quantified, from which the human-centric features are derived. Afterwards, the Gaussian process regression model mapping visual-audio feature space to an fMRI-derived feature space is trained, given the training samples. The trained model is then adopted to predict fMRI-derived features for videos without the fMRI data. Finally, the multi-modal spectral clustering and multi-modal ranking algorithm are adopted and proposed to integrate these two heterogeneous features for video clustering and retrieval, respectively. Our experiment on TRECVID database has demonstrated the precision of video clustering and retrieval can be substantially improved by integration of visual-audio features and fMRI-derived features."

Results showed that positive and negative emotional memories triggered more fixations and saccades but shorter fixation duration than neutral memories. No significant differences were observed between emotional and neutral memories for duration and amplitude of saccades. Positive and negative retrieval triggered similar eye movement (i.e., similar number of fixations and saccades, fixation duration, duration of saccades, and amplitude of saccades). Interestingly, the participants reported higher visual imagery for emotional memories than for neutral memories. The findings demonstrate similarities and differences in eye movement during retrieval of neutral and emotional memories. Eye movement during autobiographical retrieval seems to be triggered by the creation of visual mental images as the latter are indexed by autobiographical reconstruction."

The governing equation of the tethered satellite system and classic linear feedback tension control law were first reviewed and examined as a benchmark. Then, a new fractional order tension control law has been to avoid the tethered satellite winds around the main satellite near the end of retrieval by existing integer order tension control laws. The newly proposed control law has been discretized and implemented by the Laplace transform and Tustin operator. Unlike the existing integer order control laws, which are based on the feedback of current state and memoryless, the fractional order control law has the memory of previous states and thus controls the tether retrieval more smoothly while maintaining the retrieving speed. The effectiveness and advantage of the new fractional order tension control law is demonstrated numerically by comparing with its integer order counterpart. The results show that the new control law not only retrieves the subsatellite without winding around the main satellite, but also provides a better control performance with smaller in-plane libration angles."

Items that had undergone retrieval practice were better recalled than reread items on a final test 2 days later, but this effect did not interact with incentive level.

In a retrospective case series, four patients with ovarian bleeding after TVOR were included. In addition, a pooled analysis of all published cases (n = 32) who underwent surgical intervention for severe haematoperitoneum caused by ovarian bleeding after TVOR was carried out. Main outcome measures were incidence, risk factors, course and intraoperative findings. In the pooled analysis, the incidence was 0.08%. The first sign of haematoperitoneum was evident in 33.3% within the first postoperative hour, and, cumulatively, in 93.3% within 24\u2009h. The median time between TVOR and surgical intervention was 10\u2009h. In four patients, the ovary could not be preserved, which was associated with a longer time interval between TVOR and the onset of symptoms (median 18\u2009h versus 2.5\u2009h; P = 0.004) as well as between TVOR and surgical intervention (median 21.5\u2009h versus 8.5\u2009h; 0.004). In conclusion, severe haematoperitoneum occurs in 0.08% after TVOR. Late-onset bleeding is common. A longer time interval between TVOR and surgical intervention might put a patient at risk of ovariectomy."

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare several approaches to soil moisture (SM) retrieval using l-band microwave radiometry. The comparison was based on a brightness temperature (TB) data set acquired since 2010 by the L-band radiometer ELBARA-II over a vineyard field at the Valencia Anchor Station (VAS) site. ELBARA-II, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the scientific program of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission, measures multiangular TB data at horizontal and vertical polarization for a range of incidence angles (30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0). Based on a three year data set (2010\u20132012), several SM retrieval approaches developed for spaceborne missions including AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS), SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS were compared. The approaches include: the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) for horizontal (SCA-H) and vertical (SCA-V) polarizations, the Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and two simplified approaches based on statistical regressions (referred to as \u2018Mattar\u2019 and \u2018Saleh\u2019). Time series of vegetation indices required for three of the algorithms (SCA-H, SCA-V and \u2018Mattar\u2019) were obtained from MODIS observations. The SM retrievals were evaluated against reference SM values estimated from a multiangular 2-Parameter inversion approach. As no in situ SM data was used, the evaluation made here is relative to the use of this specific reference data set. The results obtained with the current base line algorithms developed for SMAP (SCA-H and -V) are in very good agreement with the \u2018reference\u2019 SM data set derived from the multi-angular observations (R2 \u2248 0.90, RMSE varying between 0.035 and 0.056 m3/m3 for several retrieval configurations). This result showed that, provided the relationship between vegetation optical depth and a remotely-sensed vegetation index can be calibrated, the SCA algorithms can provide results very close to those obtained from multi-angular observations in this study area. The approaches based on statistical regressions provided similar results and the best accuracy was obtained with the \u2018Saleh\u2019 methods based on either bi-angular or bipolarization observations (R2 \u2248 0.93, RMSE \u2248 0.035 m3/m3). The LPRM and DCA algorithms were found to be slightly less successful in retrieving the \u2018reference\u2019 SM time series (R2 \u2248 0.75, RMSE \u2248 0.055 m3/m3). However, the two above approaches have the great advantage of not requiring any model calibrations previous to the SM retrievals."

We studied PPC patients' recognition and source memory performance, as well as subjective recollection as indexed by Remember/Know judgments. PPC patients had preserved recognition memory, and gave a similar number of R responses as did controls. Moreover, PPC patients' source memory performance, including memory for multiple contextual features, was similar to the controls'. However, whereas healthy controls were more likely to select R responses with correct multifeatural source judgments compared to K responses, PPC patients were not.

The brain is remarkable for large memory capacity and robust memory retrieval. These characteristics are due to the specific structure of the brain. In this paper, an associative memory with large capacity and robust retrieval is introduced that is inspired by the cortical structure. The proposed model is called Columnar-Organized Memory (COM). Its architecture is based on the spiking winner-take-all (WTA): There are lateral excitatory connections between the WTAs and lateral inhibitory connections between the neurons of a WTA. Training of COM involves a two-phase algorithm: pattern storage phase and pattern association phase. The pattern storage phase is based on a spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule and the pattern association phase is compatible with the classic Hebbian rule. The key characteristics of the proposed model are storing a large number of messages and retrieving them accurately. These properties are related to its structure notably; robust retrieval is a consequence of the lateral excitatory connections. Also, the overall effect of the lateral inhibitory connections is large storage capacity."

Retrieval of memories has been shown to involve some form of executive act that diminishes the accessibility of rival memory traces, leading to retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). These executive control processes might suppress unwanted thoughts and irrelevant memories during competitive retrieval. We assessed RIF with the retrieval practice paradigm among 25 OCD patients and 25 healthy controls matched for age and education. Retrieval of target memories led to enhancement of target memory recall in both groups, but suppression of related memories (RIF) occurred only among controls. Our results suggest that suppression of irrelevant, interfering memories during competitive recall is impaired in OCD."

        "abstract": "Computer-assisted image retrieval applications can assist radiologists by identifying similar images in archives as a means to providing decision support. In the classical case, images are described using low-level features extracted from their contents, and an appropriate distance is used to find the best matches in the feature space. However, using low-level image features to fully capture the visual appearance of diseases is challenging and the semantic gap between these features and the high-level visual concepts in radiology may impair the system performance. To deal with this issue, the use of semantic terms to provide high-level descriptions of radiological image contents has recently been advocated. Nevertheless, most of the existing semantic image retrieval strategies are limited by two factors: they require manual annotation of the images using semantic terms and they ignore the intrinsic visual and semantic relationships between these annotations during the comparison of the images. Based on these considerations, we propose an image retrieval framework based on semantic features that relies on two main strategies: (1) automatic \u201csoft\u201d prediction of ontological terms that describe the image contents from multi-scale Riesz wavelets and (2) retrieval of similar images by evaluating the similarity between their annotations using a new term dissimilarity measure, which takes into account both image-based and ontological term relations. The combination of these strategies provides a means of accurately retrieving similar images in databases based on image annotations and can be considered as a potential solution to the semantic gap problem. We validated this approach in the context of the retrieval of liver lesions from computed tomographic (CT) images and annotated with semantic terms of the RadLex ontology. The relevance of the retrieval results was assessed using two protocols: evaluation relative to a dissimilarity reference standard defined for pairs of images on a 25-images dataset, and evaluation relative to the diagnoses of the retrieved images on a 72-images dataset. A normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) score of more than 0.92 was obtained with the first protocol, while AUC scores of more than 0.77 were obtained with the second protocol. This automatical approach could provide real-time decision support to radiologists by showing them similar images with associated diagnoses and, where available, responses to therapies."

The Color Difference Histogram (CDH) and Angular Radial Transform (ART) features are exploited to capture color, texture and shape information of an image. The CDH algorithm is modified in order to make the proposed system more effective. The proposed fusion framework combines the ranking results of the aforementioned descriptors through various post-classification methods i.e. Borda Count method, Min\u2013max and Z-score normalization. The maximum retrieval accuracy attained in terms of average precision using Min\u2013max normalization on Wang\u2019s database is 78.3% when ART is applied on non-overlapping regions of the images. The proposed fusion framework is recommended because it improves the average retrieval accuracy by approximately 16% and 14% over CDH and ART respectively. Extensive experiments are carried out on different databases to establish the efficacy of the proposed scheme."

These features correspond to an edge-corner map of the given image. The resulting map is then processed by Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to derive keypoints, that are invariant to affine transformations. The ensuing features were vector quantized to build a codebook of keypoints. The codebook was produced using a Spherical Self-Organizing Map (SOM) built with a geodesic data structure termed as GeoSOM. Then keypoints of the query image are mapped with the codebook and their occurrences are counted to formulate a histogram termed as Phase Congruency-based Bag of Keypoints (PC-BoK). This histogram is generated offline for target images and a similarity measure was performed with the query image to yield the nearest match based on a global fuzzy membership function. Exhaustive experiments of the proposed framework named as BIRS (Biomedical Image Retrieval System) were performed on a diverse medical image collection (NBIA, MESSIDOR, DRIVE). Finally, performance of BIRS demonstrates the advantage of the proposed image representation approach in terms of Precision (P)\u2013Recall (R) parameters. Furthermore relative comparison of the proposed scheme with existing feature descriptors depicts improved P\u2013R values. The proposed feature extraction and representation scheme was also robust against quantization errors."

Moreover, shape irregularity can be a problem since Gabor and curvelet transforms can only be applied on the regular shapes. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses both the Gabor wavelet and the curvelet transforms on the transferred regular shapes of the image regions. We also apply a fitting method to encode the sub-bands\u2019 information in the polynomial coefficients to create a texture feature vector with the maximum power of discrimination.

As one of the promising approaches, salient point based image retrieval has attracted many researchers. However, the related work is usually very time consuming, and some salient points always may not represent the most interesting subset of points for image indexing. Based on fast and performant salient point detector, and the salient point expansion, a novel content-based image retrieval using local visual attention feature is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the salient image points are extracted by using the fast and performant SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) detector. Then, the visually significant image points around salient points can be obtained according to the salient point expansion. Finally, the local visual attention feature of visually significant image points, including the weighted color histogram and spatial distribution entropy, are extracted, and the similarity between color images is computed by using the local visual attention feature. Experimental results, including comparisons with the state-of-the-art retrieval systems, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal."

We recorded EEGs while subjects judged whether pairs of words that represented object features combined to elicit a retrieval of an object memory or no retrieval. Syndrome 2 subjects' responses were significantly slower, and those participants were less accurate than controls on the retrieval trials, but they performed similarly on the nonretrieval trials. Analysis of the ERPs revealed a difference between retrievals and nonretrievals that has previously been detected around 750 ms at the left temporal region was present in both the Syndrome 2 patients and controls. However, the Syndrome 2 patients also showed an ERP difference between retrievals and nonretrievals at the midline parietal region that had a scalp voltage polarity opposite from that recorded at the left temporal area. We hypothesize that the similarities between task performance and ERP patterns in Syndrome 2 veterans and in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment reflect disordered thalamic cholinergic neural activity, possibly in the dorsomedial nucleus."

This trend is expected to grow in the future as the number of publications is constantly increasing because of industrial interest in the current economic context. The frame of this work is the development of a decision-support system to work out an assignment strategy between scheduling problems, mathematical modelling options and appropriate solving methods. The system must answer the question about which model and which solution method should be applied to solve a new scheduling problem in the most convenient way. The decision-support system is to be built on the foundations of Case Based Reasoning (CBR). CBR is based on a data base which encompasses previously successful experiences. The three major contributions of this paper are: (i) the proposition of an extended and a more exhaustive classification and notation scheme in order to obtain an efficient scheduling case representation (based on previous ones), (ii) a method for bibliographic analysis used to perform a deep study to fill the case base on the one hand, and to examine the topics the more or the less examined in the scheduling domain and their evolution over time on the other hand, and (iii) the proposition of criteria to extract relevant past experiences during the retrieval step of the CBR.

        "abstract": "To investigate neural mechanisms that support semantic functions in aging, we recorded scalp EEG during an object retrieval task in 22 younger and 22 older adults. The task required determining if a particular object could be retrieved when two visual words representing object features were presented. Both age groups had comparable accuracy although response times were longer in older adults. In both groups a left fronto-temporal negative potential occurred at around 750 ms during object retrieval, consistent with previous findings (Brier, Maguire, Tillman, Hart, &amp; Kraut, 2008). In only older adults, a later positive frontal potential was found peaking between 800 and 1000 ms during no retrieval. These findings suggest younger and older adults employ comparable neural mechanisms when features clearly facilitate retrieval of an object memory, but when features yield no retrieval, older adults use additional neural resources to engage in a more effortful and exhaustive search prior to making a decision."

The proposed three-dimensional (3D) absolute shape measurement technique includes the following major steps: (1) segment the measured object into different regions using rough priori knowledge of surface geometry; (2) artificially create phase maps at different z planes using geometric constraints of structured light system; (3) unwrap the phase pixel by pixel for each region by properly referring to the artificially created phase map; and (4) merge unwrapped phases from all regions into a complete absolute phase map for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate that conventional three-step phase-shifted fringe patterns can be used to create absolute phase map pixel by pixel even for large depth range objects. We have successfully implemented our proposed computational framework to achieve absolute 3D shape measurement at 40 Hz."

The purpose of this study is to directly and empirically examine whether the presumption against consent is justified in the case of posthumous gamete retrieval following sudden death. Respondents (N = 2064) were contacted using a random-digit dialing method that gave every household telephone in the continental United States an equal probability of being contacted, and were asked: \u201cSuppose you were to experience an early death and your spouse wanted to have a biological child with you. Would you or would you not want your spouse to be able to use your sperm/eggs following your death to have a child with you?\u201d Among reproductive age respondents (18\u201344 years), 70% of males and 58% of females wanted their spouse to be able to use their gametes and, for the most part, attitudes were fairly consistent across demographic characteristics. Religiosity was the best predictor of attitudes\u2014those who described themselves as more religious were less likely to desire posthumous gamete retrieval\u2014but the majority (58%) of respondents who were very religious approved of retrieval. Overall, these data indicate that abandoning the prevailing presumption against consent in favor of a presumption of consent on the part of the deceased will result in the deceased's wishes being honored two and three times more often for females and males, respectively. Three main arguments against a presumption of consent in this context are discussed: autonomy of the deceased, conflict of interest, and the decision-making capacity of a grieving spouse."

Present study compared the two retrieval approach based on canopy radiative transfer (CRT) method and empirical method using four vegetation indices (VI) (e.g. NDVI, NDWI, RVI and GNDVI) to estimate the wheat LAI. Reflectance observations available at very high (56 m) spatial resolution from Advanced Wide-Field Sensor (AWiFS) sensor onboard Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) P6, Resourcesat-1 satellite was used in this study. This study was performed over two different wheat growing regions, situated in different agro-climatic settings/environments: Trans-Gangetic Plain Region (TGPR) and Central Plateau and Hill Region (CPHR). Forward simulation of canopy reflectances in four AWiFS bands viz. green (0.52\u20130.59 \u03bcm), red (0.62\u20130.68 \u03bcm), NIR (0.77\u20130.86 \u03bcm) and SWIR (1.55\u20131.70 \u03bcm) were carried out to generate the look up table (LUT) using CRT model PROSAIL from all combinations of canopy intrinsic variables. An inversion technique based on minimization of cost function was used to retrieve LAI from LUT and observed AWiFS surface reflectances. Two consecutive wheat growing seasons (November 2005\u2013March 2006 and November 2006\u2013March 2007) datasets were used in this study. The empirical models were developed from first season data and second growing season data used for validation. Among all the models, LAI-NDVI empirical model showed the least RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.54 and 0.51 in both agro-climatic regions respectively. The comparison of PROSAIL retrieved LAI with in situ measurements of 2006\u20132007 over the two agro-climatic regions produced substantially less RMSE of 0.34 and 0.41 having more R2 of 0.91 and 0.95 for TGPR and CPHR respectively in comparison to empirical models. Moreover, CRT retrieved LAI had less value of errors in all the LAI classes contrary to empirical estimates. The PROSAIL based retrieval has potential for operational implementation to determine the regional crop LAI and can be extendible to other regions after rigorous validation exercise."

At each position in the image, and for each resolution level, we consider both vertical and horizontal wavelet detail coefficients as the components of a bivariate random vector. The magnitudes and angles of these vectors are computed. At each level the empirical histogram of magnitudes is modeled by a Generalized Gamma distribution, and the empirical histogram of angles is modeled by a different version of the von Mises distribution that accounts for histograms with 2 modes. Each texture is characterized by few parameters. A new distance is presented (based on the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence) that allows giving relative importance to each model and to each resolution level. This distance is later conveniently adapted to provide for rotation invariance, by establishing equivalence classes over distributions of angles. Through a broad set of experiments on three different image databases, we demonstrate that our new descriptor and distance measure can be successfully applied in the context of texture retrieval. We compare our system to several relevant methods in this field in terms of retrieval performance and number of parameters used by each method. We also include some classification tests. In all the tests, we obtain superior retrieval rates for a set of fewer parameters involved."

The reasoning behind this process is difficult to document and share, which is a major obstacle in adopting evidence-based medicine in radiology. We report our attempt to use a comprehensive brain parcellation tool to systematically capture image features and use them to record, search, and evaluate anatomical phenotypes. Anatomical images (T1-weighted MRI) were converted to a standardized index by using a high-dimensional image transformation method followed by atlas-based parcellation of the entire brain. We investigated how the indexed anatomical data captured the anatomical features of healthy controls and a population with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). PPA was chosen because patients have apparent atrophy at different degrees and locations, thus the automated quantitative results can be compared with trained clinicians' qualitative evaluations. We explored and tested the power of individual classifications and of performing a search for images with similar anatomical features in a database using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The agreement between the automated z-score and the averaged visual scores for atrophy (r = 0.8) was virtually the same as the inter-evaluator agreement. The PCA plot distribution correlated with the anatomical phenotypes and the PLS-DA resulted in a model with an accuracy of 88% for distinguishing PPA variants. The quantitative indices captured the main anatomical features. The indexing of image data has a potential to be an effective, comprehensive, and easily translatable tool for clinical practice, providing new opportunities to mine clinical databases for medical decision support."

This is based on the concept that spoken segments similar in acoustic feature vector sequences to those with higher/lower relevance scores should have higher/lower scores, while graph-based re-ranking further uses a graph to consider the similarity structure among all the segments retrieved in the first pass. These approaches are formulated on both word and subword lattices, and a complete framework of using them in open vocabulary retrieval of spoken content is presented.

Extinction does not erase a fear association, but instead creates a competing association that may or may not be retrieved when a cue is subsequently encountered. Characterizing the conditions under which extinction learning is expressed is important to enhancing the treatment of anxiety disorders that rely on extinction-based exposure therapy as a primary treatment technique. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which plays a critical role in the expression of extinction memory, has been shown to be functionally impaired after stress exposure. Further, recent work in rodents has demonstrated that exposure to stress leads to deficits in extinction retrieval, although this has yet to be tested in humans. To explore how stress might influence extinction retrieval in humans, participants underwent a differential aversive learning paradigm, in which one image was probabilistically paired with an aversive shock while the other image denoted safety. Extinction training directly followed, at which point reinforcement was omitted. A day later, participants returned to the lab and either completed an acute stress manipulation (i.e., cold pressor), or a control task, before undergoing an extinction retrieval test. Skin conductance responses and salivary cortisol concentrations were measured throughout each session as indices of fear arousal and neuroendocrine stress response, respectively. The efficacy of our stress induction was established by observing significant increases in cortisol for the stress condition only. We examined extinction retrieval by comparing conditioned responses during the last trial of extinction (day 1) with that of the first trial of re-extinction (day 2). Groups did not differ on initial fear acquisition or extinction, however, a day later participants in the stress group (n = 27) demonstrated significantly lower extinction retrieval (i.e., greater fear recovery) than those in the control group (n = 25). Our results suggest that acute stress impairs the retrieval of extinction learning and offers insight into why treatment strategies used in the clinic may be challenging to recruit in daily life where stress is pervasive."

However, few studies investigated the neurochemical mechanisms that mediate the prefrontal retrieval process. In the current study, we examined whether N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the mPFC were necessary for retrieval of a well-learned spatial location on the basis of partial or degraded spatial cues. Rats were initially trained to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze using four extramaze cues in the surrounding environment. Their retrieval performance was subsequently tested under different cue conditions. Infusions of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a NMDAR antagonist, significantly disrupted memory retrieval when three of the original cues were removed. By contrast, APV injections into the mPFC did not affect animals\u2019 retrieval performance when the original cues were presented or when three novels landmarks were added alongside the original cues. These results indicate that prefrontal NMDARs are required for memory retrieval when allocentric spatial information is degraded. NMDAR-dependent neurotransmission in the mPFC may facilitate an active retrieval process to reactivate complete contextual representations associated with partial retrieval cues."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we integrate the concept of directional local extremas and their magnitude based patterns for content based image indexing and retrieval. The standard ditectional local extrama pattern (DLEP) extracts the directional edge information based on local extrema in 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0 directions in an image. However, they are not considering the magnitudes of local extremas. The proposed method integrates these two concepts for better retrieval performance. The sign DLEP (SDLEP) operator is a generalized DLEP operator and magnitude DLEP (MDLEP) operator is calculated using magnitudes of local extremas. The performance of the proposed method is compared with DLEP, local binary patterns (LBPs), block-based LBP (BLK_LBP), center-symmetric local binary pattern (CS-LBP), local edge patterns for segmentation (LEPSEG) and local edge patterns for image retrieval (LEPINV) methods by conducting two experiments on benchmark databases, viz. Corel-5K and Corel-10K databases. The results after being investigated show a significant improvement in terms of their evaluation measures as compared to other existing methods on respective databases."

We also investigate the capability of the satellite products in streamflow simulations using the VIC hydrological model. Results show that the 3B42 and CMORPH perform better than the 3B42RT and PERSIANN at both plateau and basin scales. The 3B42RT and PERSIANN considerably overestimate the gauge precipitation estimates almost over the entire plateau, and the PERSIANN fail to capture the spatial and temporal pattern of the gauge precipitation estimates. For different satellite estimates, the error sources are systematically different for various seasons. For the 3B42, the miss bias is the main problem. The CMORPH exhibits obvious negative hit bias and miss bias in the rainy season and false-rain bias in the non-rainy season. The total bias in the 3B42RT and PERSIANN mainly attribute to positive hit bias in the rainy season and false-rain bias in the non-rainy season. The 3B42RT and PERSIANN show little capability for streamflow simulations over the TP, while the CMORPH exhibits an encouraging potential for hydrological applications in this regions in spite of the general underestimates. The 3B42 shows comparable performance to the CMA (China Meteorological Administration) data in both monthly and daily streamflow simulations mostly due to the monthly gauge adjustment involved in it."

Plasma corticosterone levels were measured after memory testing in four randomly chosen animals of each trained group and after a single training trial in the maze in additional facial nerve-lesioned (N = 4) and sham-operated animals (N = 4). Significant differences respecting the elevation of corticosterone concentration after either a single training trial or memory testing indicated that stress response was enhanced in facial nerve-lesioned animals as compared to control ones.

To learn BN network structures, meta-heuristic techniques including tabu search (TS), simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) were empirically evaluated and compared for efficiency. The proposed models were applied to the Tanshui river basin in Taiwan. The meteorological data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) comprises seven passive microwave brightness temperatures, and was used to detect rain rates. The data consisted of 71 typhoons affecting the watershed during 2000\u20132012. A preliminary analysis using simple meta-heuristic BNs identified the main attributes, namely the brightness temperatures of 19, 22, 37 and 85 GHz for rainfall retrieval. Based on the preliminary analysis of a simple BN run, the advanced BNs combined with SI and PCT successfully demonstrated improved rain rate retrieval accuracy. To compare the proposed meta-heuristic BNs, the traditional SI method, the SI-based support vector regression model (SI-SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used as benchmarks. The results showed that (1) meta-heuristic BN techniques can be used to identify the vital attributes of the rainfall retrieval problem and their causal relationships and (2) according to a comparison of BNs combined with PCT and SI and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models (SI-SVR and ANN), in heavy, torrential, and pouring rainfall, models of BNs combined with PCT and SI provide a superior retrieval performance than that of AI-based models. Therefore, this study confirms that meta-heuristic BNs combined with PCT and SI is an efficient tool for addressing rainfall retrieval problems."

The combined effects of wear, biological environment, and in vivo occurring peculiar events as metal staining were evaluated on five retrieved ZTA femoral heads with implantation time ranging from 9 to 106 months. The protocol relies on the application of a polar grid on the entire surface of the head, which divides it into small sectors; each sector is then automatically screened with micrometer resolution. Maps are finally linked to each other and an in-toto view of the retrieved head becomes available in three dimensions. Upon combining analytical techniques with a solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD) software, it becomes possible to develop a 3D model of the femoral head, which comprehensively describes topographic, crystallographic, and micromechanical characteristics of the entire surface and immediate sub-surface. The combination of CAD, polarized Raman spectroscopy, and laser microscopy has led to in-toto screening of femoral head with micrometer-scale resolution, thus providing a new and comprehensive protocol for both quality assessments on new components and failure analysis on retrievals."

Our goal is to enable an independent committee to fairly recover the original private medical records so that medical investigation can be carried out in a convincing way. We achieve this goal with a fair remote retrieval (FRR) model in which either t investigation committee members cooperatively retrieve the original medical data or none of them can get any information on the medical records. We realize the first FRR scheme by exploiting fair multi-member key exchange and homomorphic privately verifiable tags.

In such domains, users need to retrieve precise, trusted, and relevant health and food information. Even with a high-quality, semantic, Web-based search engine, it is not enough for retrieving the precise health- and nutrition-related information. That is because the retrieved information might not fit the user's specific needs due to the huge amount of information scattered throughout the Web. Thus, semantic query manipulation and personalization techniques will help and guide users in retrieving more relevant health and nutrition information consistent with their needs. In this paper, we present our efforts to develop a framework for semantic query manipulation and personalization of health and nutrition information. We propose a user profile ontology based on culture, language, health and nutrition. The profile is used to enrich the query and to personalize the retrieved health and food information to be consistent with the user's needs. Moreover, we propose query templates that are used for semantic manipulation and mapping of the user's natural language queries into ontology-based queries. We have implemented the proposed framework, and the empirical evaluations show promising improvements in the relevancy of the retrieved results and of the user's satisfaction."

Retrieval practice involves attempting to reinstate a prior learning context, and when retrieval is successful, the representation of context is updated to include features of retrieved contexts and the current context. Future retrieval is enhanced because updated context representations can be used to restrict the search set and hone in on a desired target. The context account accommodates a wide variety of phenomena in the retrieval practice literature and provides a comprehensive and cohesive account of retrieval-based learning."

Interestingly, recent evidence has shown that \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors are particularly involved in CTA retrieval. Memory reconsolidation has been proposed as a destabilization and re-stabilization process induced by memory reactivation. We have recently suggested that reconsolidation could be enabled in the absence of retrieval. Hence, we decided to analyze the participation of AMPA and NMDA receptors of the central (CeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in CTA memory retrieval and reconsolidation. To do so, we tested whether administrations of an AMPA receptor blocker (NBQX) or an NMDA receptor blocker (APV) 15 min before a second acquisition trial could have effects on taste aversion. We found that administration of NBQX in the BLA blocked retrieval, whereas APV blocked reconsolidation in the BLA, and consolidation in the CeA. When we administered both NBQX and APV into the BLA before the second acquisition trial, results showed impairment of both retrieval and reconsolidation. These results further support the idea that reconsolidation is independent of retrieval, since retrieval blockade in the BLA did not impair memory reconsolidation. These results suggest that glutamate receptors have different participation on retrieval and reconsolidation of CTA and further support the hypothesis that these two processes could be independent."

Previous studies showed that RIF is eliminated when retrieval-practice is carried out under psycho-social stress, anxiety, or in negative mood. However, pharmacological manipulation by hydrocortisone did not eliminate the effect. This study investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on stress-induced modulations of RIF, addressing possible interactive effects of the glucocorticoid and sympatho\u2013adrenomedullary systems. Participants learned categorized word lists and then received either 60 mg propranolol or a placebo. After 90 min they were exposed to the TSST. A third group did not receive any medication and performed a non-stressful control task with the same timing as the other two groups. Finally, all participants underwent retrieval-practice and final recall. Both TSST groups exhibited a stress-induced increase in cortisol-levels, and the placebo group also exhibited large increases in markers of sympathetic nervous system activity and more psychological distress at the time of retrieval-practice. Although, overall recall was poorer under stress, an overall RIF effect emerged irrespective of group and showed no clear modulation by stress with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. In previous demonstrations of RIF elimination by negative emotion, state induction and retrieval-practice followed very briefly after initial learning. Given that both the previous study of hydrocortisone effects on RIF and the present study used longer delays between learning and retrieval-practice, the possibility that stress effects on retrieval-practice eliminate RIF only relatively briefly after learning is discussed."

This paper proposes a novel sketch-based 3D model retrieval approach which utilizes both global feature-based and local feature-based techniques. Unlike current approaches which use either global or local features, as well as do not take into account semantic relations between local features, we extract these two kinds of feature information from the representative 2D views of 3D models that can facilitate semantic description and retrieval for 3D models. Global features represent the gross exterior boundary shape information, and local features describe the interior details by compact visual words. Specifically, an improved bag-of-features method is provided to extract local features and their latent semantic relations. In addition, an efficient two-stage matching strategy is used to measure the distance between the query sketch and 3D models for selection and refinement. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach which combines these two kinds of complementary features significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches."

The recently proposed Local Tetra Pattern (LTrP) represents the image by the directional information and gives promising results. This paper proposes Local Oppugnant Color Texture Pattern (LOCTP), an enhancement of LTrP, which is able to discriminate the information derived from spatial inter-chromatic texture patterns of different spectral channels within a region. It determines the relationship in terms of the intensity and directional information between the referenced pixels and their oppugnant neighbors. The LOCTP strives to use the harmonized link between color and texture, which helps the system to incorporate the human perception. The experimental analysis of the proposed method is done with state-of-art techniques by using standard image databases Brodatz texture database (DB1) and Corel database (DB2). Also, the evaluation has been done in various color models like YCbCr, HSV, Lab, and RGB. In addition, a feature-level fusion framework is used to combine the Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) and the LOCTP for getting better result in natural images. The experimental results show considerable improvement in terms of average precision, average recall and average retrieval rate when compared with the previous works."

Unlike most of the existing systems that focus on finding either a better sparse representation in hash space or an optimal solution to preserve the pairwise similarity of the original data, we intend to solve these two problems in one goal. More specifically, SEH firstly generates sparse representations in a data-driven way, and then learns a projection matrix, taking sparse representing, affinity preserving and linear embedding into account. In order to make the learned compact features locality sensitive, SEH employs the matrix factorization technique to approximate the Euclidean structures of the original data. The usage of the matrix factorization enables the decomposed matrix to be constructed from either visual or textual features depending on which kind of Euclidean structure is preserved. Due to this flexibility, our SEH framework could handle both single-modal retrieval and cross-modal retrieval simultaneously. Experimental evidence shows this method achieves much better performance in both single- and cross-modal retrieval tasks as compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

In the present study we explored whether retrieval orientation is influenced by knowing when an old stimulus was first encoded. Participants completed separate remember/know test blocks for old items from a recent delay (40 min) and old items from a remote delay (48 h). Manipulations at encoding ensured that performance levels were matched between these two blocks, thus avoiding confounds with differences in retrieval effort. Importantly, a third test block comprised old items from both delays randomly intermixed. As the nature of the old items varies unpredictably in the mixed block, it should not be possibly to adopt a specific retrieval orientation and the mixed block therefore acts as a control condition. Participants saw the words \u201cmixed,\u201d \u201crecent\u201d or \u201cremote\u201d prior to each test block. Comparing ERPs from the recent and remote blocks permitted an investigation of whether participants alter their retrieval orientation in response to the specific length of the retention interval. Comparing ERPs from the pure (recent and remote) test blocks to ERPs from the mixed block permitted an investigation of whether delay information per se led to differences in retrieval strategy. Analysis of the ERP data found no differences between the recent and remote blocks. However, ERPs from these pure blocks were significantly less positive than ERPs from the mixed block from 200 ms towards the end of the epoch. The findings suggest that the delay information was useful in a general sense and encouraged retrieval strategies distinct from those engaged in the mixed block. We speculate that such strategies might relate to whether or not the retrieval search is specific and constrained and/or whether processes that serve to reinstate the original encoding context are engaged."

        "abstract": "Semantic gap, which refers to the limitation that low-level hand-crafted visual features insufficiently encode high-level semantic concepts contained in the images, has been a challenging issue in image retrieval and significantly impairs the performance of real-world retrieval systems. Despite massive efforts that have been devoted to developing effective image signatures, e.g., Bag-of-Visual-Words (BOVW), the Fisher Vector (FV) and the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), these mid-level image features still fail to handle the problem of semantic gap and thus lead to suboptimal results. Towards this end, a large body of work focuses on introducing attribute learning into a variety of vision applications. As inherent nature that describes the intrinsic properties of objects, such as color, shape and rigidity, learned attributes serve as intermediate representations that bridge the semantic gap. However, conventional attribute embedding methods are generally developed for image global representation while ignoring local spatial cues, which prevents them from achieving desirable performance. In this paper, we attempt to encode weak spatial information into attribute embedding for effective image retrieval. Specifically, we partition the image into regular grids and extract Classemes attribute vector from each patch, which results in a large pool of Classemes descriptors followed by VLAD aggregation for generating holistic representation. In order to produce a compact and discriminative code, we employ a piecewise Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) for dimension reduction and concatenate all the compressed Classemes into a single vector coined Spatially Pooled Attributes (SPA). Thorough experimental evaluation and comparative study on three public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach."

In the last decade, important findings were presented concerning the location (e.g., prefrontal), kind (e.g., \u2018underactivation,\u2019 \u2018overactivation\u2019), and meaning (e.g., functional deficits, compensation) of these changes. Less is known about how functional connections between specific brain regions are affected by age and how these changes are related to behavioral performance. To address these issues, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine retrieval-related brain activation and functional connectivity in 18 younger individuals and 18 older individuals. We assessed working memory with a modified version of the Corsi Block-Tapping test, which requires the storage and reproduction of spatial target sequences. Analyses of group differences in brain activation and functional connectivity included comparisons between younger individuals, older individuals, older high-performers, and older low-performers. In addition, we conducted a functional connectivity analysis by using a seed region approach. In comparison to younger individuals, older individuals showed lower right-hemispheric dorsolateral prefrontal activation and lower functional connectivity between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Older high-performers showed higher right dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex activation than older low-performers, as well as higher functional connectivity between these brain regions. The present results suggest age-related reductions of prefrontal activation during spatial working memory retrieval. Moreover, task-related functional connectivity appears to be lower in older adults. Performance accuracy in older adults is associated with right dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex activation, and with the functional connection between these regions."

The differences of DCTHs retrieving from CloudSat and MODIS range from \u22122.30 to 6.8 km. Likewise, the differences of DCTHs retrieving from CALIPSO and MODIS range from \u22122.66 to 6.78 km.

These descriptors are obtained by classifying each image with respect to a pre-defined vocabulary of semantic concepts. In this work, we consider the problem of improving the accuracy of semantic descriptors through cross-modal regularization, based on auxiliary text. A cross-modal regularizer, composed of three steps, is proposed. Training images and text are first mapped to a common semantic space. A regularization operator is then learned for each concept in the semantic vocabulary. This is an operator which maps the semantic descriptors of images labeled with that concept to the descriptors of the associated texts. A convex formulation of the learning problem is introduced, enabling the efficient computation of concept-specific regularization operators. The third step is the selection of the most suitable operator for the image to regularize. This is implemented through a quantization of the semantic space, where a regularization operator is associated with each quantization cell. Overall, the proposed regularizer is a non-linear mapping, implemented as a piecewise linear transformation of the semantic image descriptors to regularize. This transformation is a form of cross-modal domain adaptation. It is shown to achieve better performance than recent proposals in the domain adaptation literature, while requiring much simpler optimization."

However, the user perception usually considers the query specification and responses in a given context. In this scenario, re-ranking methods have been proposed to exploit the contextual information and, hence, improve the effectiveness of CBIR systems. Besides the effectiveness, the usefulness of those systems in real-world applications also depends on the efficiency and scalability of the retrieval process, imposing a great challenge to the re-ranking approaches, once they usually require the computation of distances among all the images of a given collection. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the re-ranking problem. It relies on the similarity of top-k lists produced by efficient indexing structures, instead of using distance information from the entire collection. Extensive experiments were conducted on a large image collection, using several indexing structures. Results from a rigorous experimental protocol show that the proposed method can obtain significant effectiveness gains (up to 12.19% better) and, at the same time, improve considerably the efficiency (up to 73.11% faster).

In this paper, we present a novel and effective method to create compact binary codes (deep binary codes) based on deep convolutional features for image retrieval. Deep binary codes are generated by comparing the response from each feature map and the average response across all the feature maps on the deep convolutional layers. Additionally, a spatial cross-summing strategy is proposed to directly generate bit-scalable binary codes. As the deep binary codes on different deep layers can be obtained by passing the image through the CNN and each of them makes a different contribution to the search accuracy, we then present a dynamic, on-the-fly late fusion approach where the top N high quality search scores from deep binary codes are automatically determined online and fused to further enhance the retrieval precision. Two strengths of the proposed methods are that the generation of deep binary codes is based on a generic model, which does not require additional training for new image domains, and that the dynamic late fusion scheme is query adaptive. Extensive experimental results on well known benchmarks show that the performance of deep binary codes are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches for large scale image retrieval.

However, certain fundamental questions remain: What sorts of measurement vectors uniquely determine every signal up to a global phase factor, and how many are needed to do so? Furthermore, which measurement ensembles yield stability? This paper presents several results that address each of these questions. We begin by characterizing injectivity, and we identify that the complement property is indeed a necessary condition in the complex case. We then pose a conjecture that 4 M \u2212 4 generic measurement vectors are both necessary and sufficient for injectivity in M dimensions, and we prove this conjecture in the special cases where M = 2 , 3 . Next, we shift our attention to stability, both in the worst and average cases. Here, we characterize worst-case stability in the real case by introducing a numerical version of the complement property. This new property bears some resemblance to the restricted isometry property of compressed sensing and can be used to derive a sharp lower Lipschitz bound on the intensity measurement mapping. Localized frames are shown to lack this property (suggesting instability), whereas Gaussian random measurements are shown to satisfy this property with high probability. We conclude by presenting results that use a stochastic noise model in both the real and complex cases, and we leverage Cramer\u2013Rao lower bounds to identify stability with stronger versions of the injectivity characterizations."

Glucocorticoids, released with a delay of several minutes in response to stressful experiences, are thought to play a key role in the stress-induced retrieval impairment. Accordingly, most studies on the impact of stress on retrieval tested memory a considerable time after stressor exposure, when glucocorticoid levels were elevated. Here, we asked how stress affects memory when retrieval takes place under stress, that is, when stress is part of the retrieval situation and glucocorticoids are not yet increased at the time of testing. To contrast stress effects on ongoing and delayed memory retrieval, 72 participants learned first neutral and emotional material. Twenty-four hours later, half of the learned material was tested either in a stressful, oral examination-like testing situation or in a standard, non-stressful free recall test. Memory for the other half of the learned material was assessed 25 min after the first, stressful or non-stressful retention test. Significant increases in blood pressure and salivary cortisol confirmed the stress induction by the first, examination-like testing situation. Retrieval performance under stress was positively correlated with the blood pressure response to the stressor but unaffected by cortisol. Conversely, retrieval performance 25 min post stress was negatively correlated with the cortisol response to the stressor, particularly for emotional items. These results suggest that the same stressor may have opposite effects on ongoing and delayed memory retrieval, depending on the presence of autonomic arousal and glucocorticoids."

Inspired by the observation that age variation is a nonlinear but smooth transform and the ability of auto-encoder network to learn latent representations from inputs, in this paper, we propose a new neural network model called coupled auto-encoder networks (CAN) to handle age-invariant face recognition and retrieval problem. CAN is a couple of two auto-encoders which bridged by two shallow neural networks used to fit complex nonlinear aging and de-aging process. We further propose a nonlinear factor analysis method to nonlinearly decompose one given face image into three components which are identity feature, age feature and noise, where identity feature is age-invariant and can be used for face recognition and retrieval. Experiments on three public available face aging datasets: FGNET, CACD and CACD-VS show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

However, it is difficult to measure image content similarity due to visual changes caused by varying viewpoint and environment. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient method to more effectively measure content similarity from image measurements. Our method is based on the ranking information available from existing retrieval systems. We observe that images within the set which, when used as queries, yield similar ranking lists are likely to be relevant to each other and vice versa. In our method, ranking consistency is used as a verification method to efficiently refine an existing ranking list, in much the same fashion that spatial verification is employed. The efficiency of our method is achieved by a list-wise min-Hash scheme, which allows rapid calculation of an approximate similarity ranking. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its applications."

The main idea behind LDA assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary. When applying the original LDA to process continuous data, the word-like unit need be first generated by vector quantization (VQ). This data discretization usually results in information loss. To overcome this shortage, this paper introduces a new topic model named Gaussian-LDA for audio retrieval. In the proposed model, we consider continuous emission probability, Gaussian instead of multinomial distribution. This new topic model skips the vector quantization and directly models each topic as a Gaussian distribution over audio features. It avoids discretization by this way and integrates the procedure of clustering. The experiments of audio retrieval demonstrate that Gaussian-LDA achieves better performance than other compared methods."

Current practices, however, mainly focus on a limited amount of wavelength bands while more information could be extracted from other wavelengths in the full range (400\u20132500 nm) spectrum. In this research, leaf characteristics were estimated from a field-based multi-species dataset, covering a wide range in leaf structures and Chl concentrations. The dataset contains leaves with extremely high Chl concentrations (&gt;100 \u03bcg cm\u22122), which are seldom estimated. Parameter retrieval was conducted with the machine learning regression algorithm Gaussian Processes (GP), which is able to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting for complex datasets. Moreover, insight in relevant bands is provided during the development of a regression model. Consequently, the physical meaning of the model can be explored. Best estimates of SLA, LWC and Chl yielded a best obtained normalized root mean square error of 6.0%, 7.7%, 9.1%, respectively. Several distinct wavebands were chosen across the whole spectrum. A band in the red edge (710 nm) appeared to be most important for the estimation of Chl. Interestingly, spectral features related to biochemicals with a structural or carbon storage function (e.g. 1090, 1550, 1670, 1730 nm) were found important not only for estimation of SLA, but also for LWC, Chl or N estimation. Similar, Chl estimation was also helped by some wavebands related to water content (950, 1430 nm) due to correlation between the parameters. It is shown that leaf parameter retrieval by GP regression is successful, and able to cope with large structural differences between leaves."

        "abstract": "Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the most important indicators of atmospheric pollution. It can be retrieved from satellite imagery using several established methods, such as the dark dense vegetation method and the deep blue algorithm. All of these methods require estimation of surface reflectance prior to retrieval, and are applicable to a certain pre-designated type of surface cover. Such limitations can be overcome by using a synergetic method of retrieval proposed in this study. This innovative method is based on the fact that the ratio K of surface reflectance at different angles/geometries is independent of wavelength as reported by Flowerdew and Haigh (1995). An atmospheric radiative transfer model was then established and resolved with the assistance of the ratio K obtained from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) spectral bands acquired from the twin satellites of Terra and Aqua whose overpass is separated by three hours. This synergetic method of retrieval was tested with 20 pairs of MODIS images. The retrieved AOD was validated against the ground observed AOD at the Taihu station of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). It is found that they are correlated with the observations at a coefficient of 0.828 at 0.47 \u03bcm and 0.921 at 0.66 \u03bcm wavelengths. The retrieved AOD has a mean relative error of 25.47% at 0.47 \u03bcm and 24.3% at 0.66 \u03bcm. Of the 20 samples, 15 and 17 fall within two standard error of the line based observed AOD data on the ground at the 0.47 \u03bcm and 0.66 \u03bcm, respectively. These results indicate that this synergetic method can be used to reliably retrieve AOD from the twin satellites MODIS images, namely Terra and Aqua. It is not necessary to determine surface reflectance first."

The development of these processes was investigated here by comparing neural correlates of retrieval orientation between 13\u201314-year-old adolescents and young adults. In each age group, event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by new test pictures were contrasted across two recognition memory tasks (specific vs. general retrieval tasks), which were designed to place greater demands on the recovery of perceptual information associated with each picture in the specific than in the general task. Memory accuracy was higher in the general than in the specific task but did not differ between age groups. In adults, new item ERPs at anterior sites were more positive going in the specific than in the general task from 400 to 1200 ms. In adolescents, the onset latency of this effect was delayed by 300 ms relative to adults, even though no age differences in response speed were obtained in either task. The magnitude of the ERP new item effect in adults correlated with response accuracy, consistent with the view that pre-retrieval processes facilitate the recovery of task-relevant information. For adolescents, this relationship was only obtained for a subset of participants with early onsetting ERP effects, supporting the claim that the influence of pre-retrieval processes depends upon their temporal onset. Together, the findings suggest age-related changes in the efficiency of using control processes to facilitate successful retrieval while highlighting the role of onset latency in mediating these changes."

A fast K-means algorithm not only shortens the length of time spent on training the image database cluster centers, but it also overcomes the cluster center re-training problem since large numbers of images are continuously added into the database. For the experiment, we use gray and color image database sets for performance comparisons and analyzes, respectively. The results show that the fast K-means algorithm is more effective, faster, and more convenient than the traditional K-means algorithm. Moreover, it overcomes the problem of spending excessive amounts of time on re-training caused by the continuous addition of images to the image database. Selection of initial cluster centers also affects the performance of cluster center training."

In the current study, we used eye-tracking to obtain trial-specific measures of encoding (eye movement patterns) during incidental (natural viewing) and intentional (strategic) encoding conditions in adults with ASD and typical controls. Using this approach, we tested the degree to which differences in encoding might contribute to recollection impairments, or whether group differences in memory primarily emerge at retrieval. Following encoding of scenes, participants were asked to distinguish between old and similar lure scenes and provide \u2018remember\u2019/\u2018familiar\u2019 responses. Intentional encoding increased eye movements and subsequent recollection in both groups to a similar degree, but the ASD group were impaired overall at the memory task and used recollection less frequently. In controls, eye movements at encoding predicted subsequent correct responses and subsequent recollection on a trial-by-trial basis, as expected. In contrast, despite a similar pattern of eye movements during encoding in the two groups, eye movements did not predict trial-by-trial subsequent memory in ASD. Furthermore, recollection was associated with lower similarity between encoding- and retrieval-related eye movements in the ASD group compared to the control group. The eye-tracking results therefore provide novel evidence for a dissociation between encoding and recollection-based retrieval in ASD."

We focus on building a robust storage system using Fountain codes from physically decentralized sources. Fountain codes, e.g. LT-codes, can achieve reduced complexity of both encoding and decoding, which caters well to the nature of such networks. We propose an energy-efficient distributed dissemination and coding scheme to build a decentralized LT-codes based storage over a network of resource-limited nodes to provide data survivability against possible failures. In the proposed scheme, each sensor node is assigned a selection probability derived from a Robust Soliton Distribution (RSD) in a distributed fashion. Source nodes then disseminate their data over the storage network randomly, in accordance with the selection probabilities. The proposed scheme is compared to similar schemes in the literature by means of simulations. We evaluate the energy required for building the storage as well as the energy needed for data retrieval from the storage system. Results show that energy consumption can be substantially reduced while achieving the required storage requirements."

In these systems, however, the high levels of user churn\u2014peers failing or leaving temporarily or permanently\u2014affect the quality of the storage service and might put data reliability on risk. Indeed, one of the main challenge of P2P storage systems has traditionally been how to guarantee that stored data can always be retrieved within some time frame. To meet this challenge, existing systems store objects with high amounts of data redundancy, rendering data availability values close to 100%, which in turn ensure optimal retrieval times (only constrained by network limits). Unfortunately, this redundancy reduces the overall net capacity of the system and increases data maintenance costs. To alleviate these problems data redundancy can be reduced at the expense of lengthening retrieval times. The problem is that both the rewards and disadvantages of doing so are not well understood. In this paper we present a novel analytical framework that allows us to model retrieval times in P2P storage systems and describe the interplay between data redundancy and retrieval times for different churn patterns. Using availability traces from real P2P applications, we show that our framework provides accurate estimation of retrieval times in realistic environments."

Formulae that are based on empirical relationships relating G to net radiation, Rn (G = \u03b1Rn, \u03b1 being a function of a vegetation index, VI) are currently used, but presented drawbacks, especially in bare or sparse vegetation areas because of the poor adequacy of VI-based relationships to account for changes in soil moisture. In this study, we proposed to link \u03b1 to the evaporative fraction, EF. In a first step, using a non-dimensional form of the surface energy balance, we demonstrated that \u03b1 is functionally related to EF and to the ratio \u03b3 = G/H (H = sensible heat flux). In a second step, we proposed an EF-based parameterisation of \u03b1, using ground fluxes data sets collected throughout the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 at four flux-tower sites in West African countries (Mali, Benin, Niger) that differ in surface conditions and Monsoon influence. The analysis indicated that the average site-specific values of \u03b1 and EF were well described by a linear relationship of the type \u03b1 = a EF + b, with a = \u22120.22 and b = 0.23.

Experiments in the retrieval scenario show the superiority of WSA in relation to Spatial Pyramids. Experiments in the classification scenario show a reasonable compromise between those methods, with Spatial Pyramids generating larger feature vectors, while WSA provides adequate performance with much more compact features.

However, the temporal evolution of soil moisture is neither easy to measure nor monitor at large scales because of its high spatial variability. This is mainly a result of the local variation in soil properties and vegetation cover. Thus, land surface models are normally used to predict the evolution of soil moisture and yet, despite their importance, these models are based on low-resolution soil property information or typical values. Therefore, the availability of more accurate and detailed soil parameter data than are currently available is vital, if regional or global soil moisture predictions are to be made with the accuracy required for environmental applications. The proposed solution is to estimate the soil hydraulic properties via model calibration to remotely sensed soil moisture observation, with in situ observations used as a proxy in this proof of concept study. Consequently, the feasibility is assessed, and the level of accuracy that can be expected determined, for soil hydraulic property estimation of duplex soil profiles in a semi-arid environment using near-surface soil moisture observations under naturally occurring conditions. The retrieved soil hydraulic parameters were then assessed by their reliability to predict the root zone soil moisture using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator model. When using parameters that were retrieved using soil moisture observations, the root zone soil moisture was predicted to within an accuracy of 0.04 m3/m3, which is an improvement of \u223c0.025 m3/m3 on predictions that used published values or pedo-transfer functions."

The objective of this paper is to develop a new method for hybrid similarity measure with five formats of attribute values: crisp symbols, crisp numbers, interval numbers, fuzzy linguistic variables and random variables. First, for each format of the attribute values, the calculation formula to measure the attribute similarity is presented. Then, the method for measuring hybrid similarity between each historical case and the target case is given by aggregating attribute similarities using the simple additive weighting method, and the proper historical case(s) can be retrieved according to the obtained hybrid similarities afterwards. Finally, a case study in the field of emergency response towards gas explosion is introduced to illustrate the use of the proposed method."

        "abstract": "The remote sounding of infrared emission from planetary atmospheres using limb-viewing geometry is a powerful technique for deriving vertical profiles of structure and composition on a global scale. Compared with nadir viewing, limb geometry provides enhanced vertical resolution and greater sensitivity to atmospheric constituents. However, standard limb profile retrieval techniques assume spherical symmetry and are vulnerable to biases produced by horizontal gradients in atmospheric parameters. We present a scheme for the correction of horizontal gradients in profile retrievals from limb observations of the martian atmosphere. It characterizes horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, and aerosol extinction along the line-of-sight of a limb view through neighboring measurements, and represents these gradients by means of two-dimensional radiative transfer in the forward model of the retrieval. The scheme is applied to limb emission measurements from the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Retrieval simulations using data from numerical models indicate that biases of up to 10 K in the winter polar region, obtained with standard retrievals using spherical symmetry, are reduced to about 2 K in most locations by the retrieval with two-dimensional radiative transfer. Retrievals from Mars atmospheric measurements suggest that the two-dimensional radiative transfer greatly reduces biases in temperature and aerosol opacity caused by observational geometry, predominantly in the polar winter regions."

Analysis of hit lists revealed counter-intuitive instances in the top ranks for good classifiers. In this study, we propose that two functions need to be optimised: (a) in order to reduce a massive set of instances to a likely subset among ten thousand or more classes, separability is required. However, the results need to be intuitive after ranking, reflecting (b) the prototypicality of instances. By optimising these requirements sequentially, the number of distracting images is strongly reduced, followed by nearest-centroid based instance ranking that retains an intuitive (low-edit distance) ranking. We show that in handwritten word-image retrieval, precision improvements of up to 35 percentage points can be achieved, yielding up to 100% top hit precision and 99% top-7 precision in data sets with 84 000 instances, while maintaining high recall performances.

All images in the database are uniformly divided into multiple regions and each region is assigned a 4-bit region code based upon its location relative to the central region. Dominant color and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based texture features are extracted from these regions. Feature vectors together with their region codes are stored and indexed in the database. During retrieval, feature vectors of regions having region codes similar to the query image region are used for comparison. To reflect the user\u2019s intent in query formulation in a better way, an effective technique for Region of Interest (ROI) overlapping block selection is also proposed. Region codes are further used to find relative locations of multiple ROIs in query and target images.

This task looks easy if you are dealing with tens of images but it gets more difficult when the number of images goes from tens to hundreds and thousands, and the same content-based searching task becomes extremely complex when the number of images is in the millions. To deal with the situation, some intelligent way of content-based searching is required to fulfill the searching request with right visual contents in a reasonable amount of time.

The estimates are derived for measuring the inversion error, the degree of model fit towards measurements (model determination coefficient) and the confidence intervals for the retrieved point source parameters (mainly, location and strength). The inversion error is reflected through an angular estimate which measures the deviation between the measured and predicted concentrations. The uncertainty estimation methodology is evaluated for point source reconstruction studies, using real measurements from two field experiments, known as Fusion Field Trials 2007 (FFT07) in flat terrain and Mock Urban Setting Test (MUST) in urban like terrain. In FFT07 and MUST experiments, the point source location is retrieved with an average Euclidean distance of 22 m and 15 m respectively. The source strength is retrieved, on average, within a factor of 1.5 in both the datasets. The inversion error is observed as 24 o and 21 o in FFT07 and MUST experiment, respectively. The 95% confidence interval estimates show that the uncertainty in the retrieved parameters is relatively large in approximately 50% FFT07 and 30% MUST trials in spite of their closeness towards true source parameters. For a comparative analysis, the interval estimates are also compared with a more general method of uncertainty estimation, Residual Bootstrap Sampling. In most of the trials, we observed that the intervals estimates with the present method are comparable (within 10\u201320% variations) to bootstrap estimates. The proposed methodology provides near accurate and computationally efficient uncertainty estimates in comparison to the methods based on Hessian and sampling procedures."

One of the important issues in real-time animation is that the existing motion retrieval techniques generally have a high matching time because they are typically based on matching time-series, making them less suitable for use with large motion databases. In this paper, we propose a different approach to motion retrieval, called Eigen-based Motion Retrieval (or EigenMR), to address this limitation of the existing methods by performing motion retrieval in the transform domain instead of the time domain. To differentiate the motion of different body parts, we propose to perform the matching on individual body parts as well as on the whole body. Our approach has the important advantage that each body part can be represented by an index of fixed size, consisting of a number of eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues. As a result, our approach has constant time complexity based on the number of motion files in the database instead of the size of the database. The experimental results show that our approach is both efficient and accurate compared with some of the latest methods. When applied to a motion database of 4 GB in size, our method requires approximately 20% of the standard time, making it more suitable for real-time animation."

We were able to retrieve both, the scattering and absorption coefficient of this layer within reasonable errors. Hereby, changes in scattering were found to have less effect on the experimental data than absorption changes, making the reliable estimation of the reduced scattering coefficient more difficult in comparison to absorption. Stability of the implemented fitting routine was thoroughly analyzed, revealing that special care is needed to obtain accurate values for the reduced scattering coefficient."

These problems will impede the customization and reuse of workflows, especially for data oriented workflows. In this paper, we will be towards workflow retrieval with variable time constraints. We propose a graph distance based approach for measuring the similarity between data oriented workflows with variable time constraints. First, a formal structure called Time Dependency Graph (TDG) is proposed and further used as representation model of workflows. Similarity comparison between two workflows can be reduced to computing the similarity between their TDGs. Second, we detect whether two TDGs of workflows for similarity comparison are compatible. A distance based measure is proposed for computing their similarity by their normalization matrices established based on their TDGs. We theoretically proof that the proposed measure satisfies the all the properties of distance. In addition, some exemplar processes are studied to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach of similarity comparison for workflows."

However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere system and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime Ta exclusively from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of daytime Ta under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous Ta under clear sky conditions (Ta , clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature (TaS) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (Ts) retrieved from MOD06_L2 product. Then a regression model between Ta , clear and Ts was established, and the instantaneous Ta under cloudy sky conditions (Ta , cloudy) was estimated by applying the regression model to Ts retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved the accuracy of Ta , clear retrievals with MAE = 1.95 \u00b0C, RMSE = 2.50 \u00b0C, and B = 0.02 in the EQB, and MAE = 2.02 \u00b0C, RMSE = 2.56 \u00b0C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The Ta , cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with Ta observations in both regions with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of RMSE calculated for the EQB and SGP were 3.42 \u00b0C and 2.91 \u00b0C, respectively. The accuracy of both Ta , clear and Ta , cloudy estimates has reached a level comparable with other traditional statistical approaches that adopt ancillary Ta measurements as training dataset. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate daytime Ta under all-weather conditions entirely based on MODIS products."

There exist linear-space data structures, that is, using O ( n ) words, that answer such queries in optimal O ( p + k ) time for an ample set of notions of relevance. However, using linear space is not sufficiently good for large text collections. In this paper we explore how far the space/time tradeoff for this problem can be pushed. We obtain three results: (1) When relevance is measured as term frequency (number of times P appears in a document T i ), an index occupying | CSA | + o ( n ) bits answers the query in time O ( t search ( p ) + k lg 2 k lg \u03b5 n ) , where CSA is a compressed suffix array indexing D , t search ( p ) is its time to find the suffix array interval of P, and \u03b5 &gt; 0 is any constant. (2) With the same measure of relevance, an index occupying | CSA | + n lg D + o ( n lg \u03c3 + n lg D ) bits answers the query in time O ( t search ( p ) + k lg \u204e k ) , where lg \u204e k is the iterated logarithm of k. (3) When the relevance depends only on the documents, an index occupying | CSA | + O ( n lg lg n ) bits answers the query in O ( t search ( p ) + k t SA ) time, where t SA is the time the CSA needs to retrieve a suffix array cell.

According to this method, first the polygonal approximation is employed to represent the outline shape by an ordered sequence of parts. Then using the Least squares model, each part is associated with a cubic polynomial curve. The obtained curves are normalized that are invariant to scaling, rotation and translation. Finally, based on shape similarity of resulting curves, a shape similarity between an input shape and its reference model is defined. A two-step matching algorithm is proposed. Experiments using several benchmark databases are performed and the obtained retrieval results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective as compared to other matching techniques."

In recent years, the support vector machine (SVM) based relevance feedbacks have been popular because they can outperform many other classifiers when the size of the training set is small, but they are often very complex and some unsatisfactory relevance of results occur frequently. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a SVM relevance feedback CBIR algorithm based on feature reconstruction, in which the covariance matrix based kernel empirical orthogonal complement component analysis is utilized. Firstly, the original input image space is projected nonlinearly onto a high-dimensional feature space by using nonlinear analysis approaches. Secondly, the covariance matrix of the positive feedback images are calculated, and the kernel empirical orthogonal complement components of the covariance matrix are also calculated. Thirdly, the new features of positive feedback images, negative feedback images, and all the remaining images are reconstructed by utilizing the kernel empirical orthogonal complement components of positive feedback images. Finally, a SVM classifier is constructed and all the images are resorted based on the new reconstructed image feature. Experiments on large databases show that the proposed algorithms are significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches."

In a RIF paradigm, participants are trained on category\u2013exemplar pairs in Phase 1. Then, some exemplars from select categories (Rp+ items) receive further practice in Phase 2. At test, impaired recall for non-practiced exemplars of the practiced categories (Rp\u2212 items) is observed relative to exemplars from non-practiced categories (Nrp items). This difference constitutes RIF. Prior reports of spontaneous recovery from RIF indicate that RIF represents a lapse rather than a loss of memory. Empirical analogs and theoretical considerations suggest that RIF should also be reversible through a change of context between Phase 2 and testing (i.e., renewal). We conducted two experiments using human participants to evaluate the context dependency of RIF. In both experiments, Phases 1 and 2 occurred in distinctly different contexts with subsequent testing occurring in either the Phase 1 context or the Phase 2 context. RIF was observed in both experiments. Experiment 1 additionally found that the magnitude of RIF was not reduced by testing in the Phase 1 context relative to testing in the Phase 2 context. Experiment 2 further tested context dependency of RIF by (1) increasing the dissimilarity between the two contexts and (2) inserting a retention interval between Phase 2 and test for half of the participants in each test context condition. The data again indicated no effect of the context manipulation. Thus, no renewal from RIF was observed in either experiment; moreover, these null findings were supported by Bayesian analyses. These results are compared with analogous inhibitory processes in the animal memory literature that typically show both physical and temporal context dependency."

On the other hand, satellites extend spatial coverage but their spatial resolution is too coarse. In order to address this issue, here we report on spatial variability in PM levels derived from high 1 km resolution AOD product of Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm developed for MODIS satellite. We apply day-specific calibrations of AOD data to predict PM2.5 concentrations within the New England area of the United States. To improve the accuracy of our model, land use and meteorological variables were incorporated. We used inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for nonrandom missingness of AOD and nested regions within days to capture spatial variation. With this approach we can control for the inherent day-to-day variability in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, which depends on time-varying parameters such as particle optical properties, vertical and diurnal concentration profiles and ground surface reflectance among others. Out-of-sample \u201cten-fold\u201d cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of model predictions. Our results show that the model-predicted PM2.5 mass concentrations are highly correlated with the actual observations, with out-of-sample R2 of 0.89. Furthermore, our study shows that the model captures the pollution levels along highways and many urban locations thereby extending our ability to investigate the spatial patterns of urban air quality, such as examining exposures in areas with high traffic. Our results also show high accuracy within the cities of Boston and New Haven thereby indicating that MAIAC data can be used to examine intra-urban exposure contrasts in PM2.5 levels."

This finding is difficult to explain because there is no episode that binds the remembered item to the experimenter-controlled context features. The current study examines the neural correlates of false context retrieval when the context features can be traced to encoding episodes of semantically-similar items. Our neuroimaging results support a \u201cdissociated source\u201d mechanism for context borrowing in false memory. We found that parahippocampal cortex (PHc) activation, thought to indicate context retrieval, was greater during trials that involved context borrowing (an incorrect, but plausible source decision) than during baseline correct context retrieval. In contrast, hippocampal activation, thought to indicate retrieval of an episodic binding, was stronger during correct source retrieval than during context borrowing. Vivid context retrieval during false recollection experiences was also indicated by increased activation in visual perceptual regions for context borrowing as compared to other incorrect source judgments. The pattern of findings suggests that context borrowing can arise when unusually strong activation of a semantically-related item's contextual features drives relatively weak retrieval of the associated episodic binding with failure to confirm the item information within that binding. This dissociated source retrieval mechanism suggests that context-driven episodic retrieval does not necessarily lead to retrieval of specific item details. That is, source information can be retrieved in the absence of item memory."

These O3 cross sections include Brion\u2013Daumont\u2013Malicet (BDM), Bass\u2013Paur (BP) and a new dataset measured by Serdyuchenko et al. (SGWCB), which is made from measurements at more temperatures and in a wider temperature range than BDM and BP, 193\u2013293 K. Relative to the BDM dataset, the SGWCB data have systematic biases of \u22122 to +4% for 260\u2013340 nm, and the BP data have smaller biases of 1\u20132% below 315 nm but larger spiky biases of up to \u00b16% at longer wavelengths. These datasets show distinctly different temperature dependences. Using different cross sections can significantly affect atmospheric retrievals. Using SGWCB data leads to retrieval failure for almost half of the OMI spatial pixels, producing large negative ozone values that cannot be handled by radiative transfer models and using BP data leads to large fitting residuals over 310\u2013330 nm. Relative to the BDM retrievals, total ozone retrieved using original SGWCB data (with linear temperature interpolation/extrapolation) typically shows negative biases of 5\u201310 DU; retrieved tropospheric ozone column generally shows negative biases of 5\u201310 DU and 5\u201320 DU for parameterized and original SGWCB data, respectively. Compared to BDM retrievals, ozone profiles retrieved with BP/SGWCB data on average show large altitude-dependent oscillating differences of up to \u00b120\u201340% biases below ~20 km with almost opposite bias patterns. Validation with ozonesonde observations demonstrates that the BDM retrievals agree well with ozonesondes, to typically within 10%, while both BP and SGWCB retrievals consistently show large altitude-dependent biases of up to \u00b120\u201370% below 20 km. Therefore, we recommend using the BDM dataset for ozone profile retrievals from UV measurements. Its improved performance is likely due to its better characterization of temperature dependence in the Hartley and Huggins bands."

Research suggests that resemblance of a new situation to one or more in memory can lead to the sense of recognition when retrieval fails. The process responsible for this sense during retrieval failure is likely feature matching, whereby features in a current situation are matched to features stored in memory to produce a sense of familiarity. This supports the long-held idea that memory traces are basically sets of features or elements from earlier experiences. However, the work presented here goes beyond merely suggesting the existence of features within memory traces; the focus of the work presented here is on the following questions: What is a feature? What exactly are the features or elements of experiences that are somehow tied together within memory traces? This chapter describes how research on the sense of recognition during retrieval failure has been used to systematically identify features of experiences that can lead to recognition."

Two integration models are proposed: the patch-based integration and image-based integration.

Research on the testing effect shows that practice involving retrieval from memory can facilitate later memory in contrast to passive restudy. Despite extensive behavioral work, the brain processes that make retrieval an effective learning strategy remain unclear. In the present experiment, we explored how initially retrieving items affected memory a day later as compared to a condition involving traditional restudy. In contrast to restudy, initial testing that contributed to future memory success was associated with engagement of several regions including the anterior hippocampus, lateral temporal cortices, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). Additionally, testing enhanced hippocampal connectivity with ventrolateral PFC and midline regions. These findings indicate that the testing effect may be contingent on processes that are typically thought to support memory success at encoding (e.g. relational binding, selection and elaboration of semantically-related information) in addition to those more often associated with retrieval (e.g. memory search)."

Lesions of the ventral basal complex (VBC) of the thalamus elicit thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, forming an animal model of central post-stroke pain (CPSP). However, no research has yet examined the involvement of learning and memory in CPSP using an animal model. The present study examined whether VBC lesions affect motor function, conditioned place preference (CPP; implicit memory), and spatial learning (explicit memory) in the acquisition and retrieval phases. The results showed that rats with VBC lesions exhibited thermal hyperalgesia in the acquisition and retrieval phases, indicating that these lesions can induce CPSP. During these phases, the rats with VBC lesions exhibited enhanced (morphine-induced) CPP learning. These lesions did not affect the rats\u2019 total distance travelled, time spent, or velocity in the spatial learning tasks. The lesions also did not affect motor function in the rotarod task. Altogether, VBC lesions resulted in CPSP and facilitated CPP (implicit memory). However, the lesions did not affect spatial learning (explicit memory) or motor function. The relationship between CPSP and learning and memory is important for patients who suffer from such central pain. The implications of the present study may provide insights into helping reduce CPSP and its associated symptoms."

        "abstract": "In phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) the standard wave retrieval formulae are usually derived based on the condition of a plane reference beam normal to the recording plane. In practice, however, the reference wave may be a spherical wave of large radius or even have a slight inclination at the same time due to the imperfect collimation and coaxality of the optical system, and this fact will introduce phase distortion for the reconstructed object wave-front. A simple digital processing algorithm without any additional measurements is proposed to determine the unknown parameters of the spherical reference wave and then correct the object wave errors reconstructed with standard wave retrieval formulae. The effectiveness of this method is verified by a series of computer simulations, and its limitation is also discussed."

For this purpose, 3D models are represented as bags of shortest paths defined over well chosen Extended Reeb Graphs, while the similarity between pairs of Extended Reeb Graphs is addressed through kernels adapted to these descriptions. Results are comparable with the best results of the literature, and the modularity and evolutivity of the method ensure its applicability to other problems, from partial shape matching to classification."

Such image data has potential to serve as a knowledge source for large-scale image applications. Facilitated by such publically available and ever-increasing loosely annotated image data on the Internet, we propose a scalable data-driven solution for annotating and retrieving Web-scale image data. We extrapolate from large-scale loosely annotated images a compact and informative representation, namely ObjectPatchNet. Each vertex in ObjectPatchNet, which is called as an ObjectPatchNode, is defined as a collection of discriminative image patches annotated with object category labels. The edge linking two ObjectPatchNodes models the co-occurrence relationship among different objects in the same image. Therefore, ObjectPatchNet models not only probabilistically labeled image patches, but also the contextual relationship between objects. It is well suited to scalable image annotation task. Besides, we further take ObjectPatchNet as a visual vocabulary with semantic labels, and hence are able to easily develop inverted file indexing for efficient semantic image retrieval. ObjectPatchNet is tested on both large-scale image annotation and large-scale image retrieval applications. Experimental results manifest that ObjectPatchNet is both discriminative and efficient in these applications."

The observed signal is a superposition of the scattering angle dependence of the cloud albedo and the Rayleigh scattered albedo controlled by ozone at the stratopause. The leverage as is defined in the paper is a way to quantify how much the net scattering angle dependence changes as a function of mode radius. The leverage is determined by decomposing the observed signal into orthogonal components which isolate the parts of the signal that are unique to changes in mode radius from those that could be due to changes in the background. This leverage is considered along with instrument noise performance to determine retrieval uncertainties and to understand minimum thresholds in the cloud retrieval parameters."

        "abstract": "Adopting effective model to access the desired images is essential nowadays with the presence of a huge amount of digital images. The present paper introduces an accurate and rapid model for content based image retrieval process depending on a new matching strategy. The proposed model is composed of four major phases namely: features extraction, dimensionality reduction, ANN classifier and matching strategy. As for the feature extraction phase, it extracts a color and texture features, respectively, called color co-occurrence matrix (CCM) and difference between pixels of scan pattern (DBPSP). However, integrating multiple features can overcome the problems of single feature, but the system works slowly mainly because of the high dimensionality of the feature space. Therefore, the dimensionality reduction technique selects the effective features that jointly have the largest dependency on the target class and minimal redundancy among themselves. Consequently, these features reduce the calculation work and the computation time in the retrieval process. The artificial neural network (ANN) in our proposed model serves as a classifier so that the selected features of query image are the input and its output is one of the multi classes that have the largest similarity to the query image. In addition, the proposed model presents an effective feature matching strategy that depends on the idea of the minimum area between two vectors to compute the similarity value between a query image and the images in the determined class. Finally, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed model provides accurate retrieval results and achieve improvement in performance with significantly less computation time compared with other models."

Seven hips (6 patients; 4 acetabular components, 7 femoral components) were identified to have ALTR. Acetabular component abduction and anteversion angles were determined using EBRA, and the contact-patch-to-rim (CPR) distance was calculated. The ALTR group had higher linear femoral and acetabular wear rates, acetabular anteversion and abduction angles, lower CPR, and longer time to revision.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of acute stress on long-term memory retrieval in healthy older people. To this end, 76 participants from 56 to 76 years old (38 men and 38 women) were exposed to an acute psychosocial stressor or a control task. After the stress/control task, the recall of pictures, words and stories learned the previous day was assessed. There were no differences in memory retrieval between the stress and control groups on any of the memory tasks. In addition, stress-induced cortisol response was not associated with memory retrieval. An age-related decrease in cortisol receptors and functional changes in the amygdala and hippocampus could underlie the differences observed between the results from this study and those found in studies performed with young people."

The above points are enabled by the following processing. The handwriting is recovered by the LK tracking to trace the move of the pen-tip. The recovered shape is localized onto the corresponding part of the electronic document with the help of document image retrieval called LLAH (locally likely arrangement hashing). A new framework for stably estimating the homography from a camera-captured image to the corresponding electronic document allows us to localize the recovered handwritings accurately. We experimentally evaluate the accuracy, processing time and memory usage of the proposed method using 30 handwritings. From the comparison to other methods that implement alternative ways for realizing the same functionality, we have confirmed that the proposed method is superior to those other methods."

However, these models are necessarily complex, containing numerous biophysical parameters which are often poorly defined. The current study develops a novel retrieval of Rubisco-limited top-of-canopy photosynthetic capacity (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate, V cmax 25 , toc ), which is one of the most critical parameters in the calculation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The retrieval combines standard remote sensing satellite products of Leaf Area Index (LAI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with a hyperspectral index of total canopy chlorophyll concentration from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Monthly values of V cmax 25 , toc are determined over a 9 year period for 296 global FLUXNET sites (catalogue made available online) and 8 Plant Functional Types (PFTs). PFT averages agree favourably with compilations of field-based measurements. However, according to a Monte Carlo analysis, our method is still currently subject to large systematic uncertainties (25\u201330%), much of which arises from the empirical relationship between maximum electron transport and leaf chlorophyll content. For all 8 PFTs, except tropical broadleaf forest, V cmax 25 , toc varies considerably across the season (generally a factor of 1.6). Similarly, variability between sites of the same PFT is significant (interquartile range is 40% of the median). This suggests an important additional role for satellites in the spatial and temporal parameterisation of carbon models. Inclusion of this temporal and spatial variability in a process-based ecophysiological model produces, respectively, an impact of 11% and 12% on simulated GPP."

As compared with controls, global vertical exploratory behavior (rearing) markedly increased during memory retrieval.

In particular, PubSearch outperforms ACM Portal by more than 77% in terms of ERR, by more than 11% in terms of NDCG, and by more than 907.5% in terms of LEX. We also re-rank the top-10 results of a subset of the original 58 user queries produced by Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, and ArnetMiner; the results show that PubSearch compares very well against these search engines as well.

The concentration of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC), an accessory pigment unique to freshwater blue-green algae, is often used as a quantitative indicator of blue-green algae in eutrophic inland waters. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the semi-analytic PC retrieval algorithm proposed by Simis et al. and to explore the potential to improve this PC algorithm so that it is more suitable for eutrophic lakes, such as Taihu Lake. In this paper, we recalculated the correction coefficients \u03b3 and \u03b4 to calculate the absorptions of chlorophyll-a at 665 nm and the absorptions of phycocyanin at 620 nm in terms of in situ measurements and observed that the values of these coefficients differed from the values used by Simis et al. and Randolph et al. The two coefficients are site dependent due to the different bio-optical properties of lakes. We also observed that the specific PC absorption at 620 nm apc*(620) decreases exponentially with an increase in PC concentrations. Therefore, a non-linear power\u2013function of apc*(620), instead of a constant value of apc*(620) as used by Simis et al., was proposed for our improved PC retrieval algorithm in Taihu Lake, yielding a squared correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.55 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 58.89 \u03bcg/L. Compared with the original PC retrieval algorithm by Simis et al., the improved retrieval algorithm has generally superior performance. In evaluating the limitation of the PC retrieval algorithms, we observed that the ratio of the total suspended solids to phycocyanin can be used as a primary measure for retrieval performance. Validation in Dianchi Lake and an error analysis proved that the improved PC algorithm has a better universality and is more suitable for eutrophic lakes with higher PC concentrations."

Our analysis shows that the remote sensing retrievals are in a good agreement with the measured airborne in-situ data from 2 to 4 km. The discrepancies observed between LIRIC and airborne measurements at the lower troposphere (below 2 km), could be explained by the spatial and temporal variability of the aerosol load within the area where the airborne data were averaged along with the different time windows of the retrievals."

This paper proposes a more accurate similarity measurement that takes into account spatial layout of visual words in an offline manner. The similarity measurement is embedded in the standard pipeline of the BoW model, and improves two features of the model: i) latent visual words are added to a query based on spatial co-occurrence, to improve query recall; and ii) weights of reliable visual words are increased to improve the precision. The combination of these methods leads to a more accurate measurement of image similarity. This is similar in concept to the combination of query expansion and spatial verification, but does not require query time processing, which is too expensive to apply to full list of ranked results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on three public datasets."

However, empirical findings regarding the relationship between cognitive inhibition and creativity remain inconclusive. The present study applies a selective attention paradigm on internal stimuli to assess cognitive inhibition. The study also differentiates open-ended and closed-ended creative problem solving as distinct indices to measure creative potentials. How cognitive inhibition correlates with different creativity measures is then explored. Experiment 1 recruited participants who performed well on the Chinese version of the Creative Thinking Test (an open-ended, divergent thinking test) and Wason's 2-4-6 problem (a closed-ended, creative problem-solving task) to perform the retrieval-induced-forgetting (RIF) task. Compared to controls, divergent thinkers showed no RIF effects while creative problem solvers did. Experiment 2 inspected individual performance on the three tasks. The results showed that, while participants with lower inhibition performed better on the divergent thinking test, performance on the creative problem-solving task was not related to RIF. Indices of divergent thinking significantly and negatively predicted extent of cognitive inhibition. These results suggest that reduced cognitive inhibition might not be a general mechanism for different kinds of creativity."

Since it takes structure of signals into consideration, it has many advantages in the structured signals process. With CS, measuring can be speeded up and the cost of hardware can be decreased significantly. However, it faces great challenge in the amplitude-only measurement. In this article, we study the magnitude-only compressed sensing phase retrieval (CSPR) problem, and propose a practical recovery algorithm. In our algorithm, we introduce the powerful Hybrid-Input\u2013Output algorithm with phase diversity to make our algorithm robust and efficient. A relaxed \u2113 0 norm constrain is also introduced to help PR find a sparse solution with fewer measurements, which is demonstrated to be essential and effective to CSPR. We finally successfully apply it into complex-valued object recovery in THz imaging. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can recover the object pretty well with fewer measurements than what PR traditionally requires."

Existing approaches mainly focus on taking short-term learning experience to identify a visual similarity measure within a single query session, or applying long-term learning methodology to infer a semantic similarity measure crossing multiple query sessions. However, there is still a big room to elevate the retrieval effectiveness, because little is known in taking the relationship between visual similarity and semantic similarity into account. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid similarity learning scheme to preserve both visual and semantic resemblance by integrating short-term with long-term learning processes. Concretely, the proposed scheme first learns a semantic similarity from the users' query log, and then, taking this as prior knowledge, learns a visual similarity from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled images. In particular, unlabeled images are exploited for the relevant and irrelevant classes differently and the visual similarity is learned incrementally. Finally, a hybrid similarity measure is produced by fusing the visual and semantic similarities in a nonlinear way for image ranking. An empirical study shows that using hybrid similarity measure for image retrieval is beneficial, and the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than some existing approaches."

Although BLA neurons have axonal connections with several brain regions, it is unclear which efferent pathways are functional in CTA. The present study investigated the involvement of efferents from BLA in CTA retrieval with manganese (Mn2+)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). Rats receiving intraoral saccharin infusion paired with intraperitoneal administration of lithium chloride (LiCl) were presented with saccharin (C-S and BC-S groups) or water (C-W group) on the test day. The BC-S group was administered with LiCl 15 min before saccharin presentation on the conditioning day (backward conditioning, BC). Another two groups were injected with saline (S-S and S-W groups) instead of LiCl. On the test day, 50 nL of 40-mM manganese chloride (MnCl2) was injected into BLA before the intraoral fluid infusion. Using MRI, we analyzed Mn2+ movements, which indicated the activation of efferent neurons. The C-S group showed the highest activities in several efferents from BLA. Of them, the activities of the efferents to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST), and the central amygdala (CeA) were larger in the C-S group than in the Q group, which was presented with a normally aversive quinine solution. Although rats equivalently rejected conditioned aversive saccharin and quinine, the aversive responses in the C-S group, and not the Q group, were due to CTA retrieval. Therefore, our results indicated that BLA efferents to NAcC, aBNST, and CeA were specifically activated during CTA retrieval, suggesting that these efferents are key components in the neural mechanisms of CTA."

This is extracted by means of the LZW data compressor which encodes the visual patterns of an image. For this reason the image is first quantized and then transformed into a 1D string of characters. Based on the multiset notion we also introduce the Normalized Multiset Distance (NMD), as a new dictionary-based dissimilarity measure which enables the user to retrieve images with similar content to a given query. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in retrieval performance compared to related dictionary-based techniques or to several other image indexing methods that utilize classical low-level image features."

Particular attention is paid to the effects of meteorological conditions, land surface properties, and the magnitude of the dust loading. The period of study corresponds to the time of the first Fennec intensive measurement campaign, which provides new ground-based and aircraft measurements of the dust characteristics and loading. Validation using ground-based AERONET sunphotometer data indicates that of the satellite products, the SEVIRI retrieval is most able to retrieve dust during optically thick dust events, whereas IASI and MODIS perform better at low dust loadings. This may significantly affect observations of dust emission and the mean dust climatology. MISR and MODIS are least sensitive to variations in meteorological conditions, while SEVIRI tends to overestimate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) under moist conditions (with a bias against AERONET of 0.31), especially at low dust loadings where the AOD &lt; 1. Further comparisons are made with airborne LIDAR measurements taken during the Fennec campaign, which provide further evidence for the inferences made from the AERONET comparisons. The effect of surface properties on the retrievals is also investigated. Over elevated surfaces IASI retrieves AODs which are most consistent with AERONET observations, while the AODs retrieved by MODIS tend to be biased low. In contrast, over the least emissive surfaces IASI significantly underestimates the AOD (with a bias of \u2212 0.41), while MISR and SEVIRI show closest agreement."

It is as yet unclear if instrumental improvements in AMSR2 over AMSR-E have led to better soil moisture (SM) estimates, especially since there is no overlapping period of data between the sensors. This study focuses on comparing the results of AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM over Australia, distinguishing four K\u00f6ppen climate zones to determine if AMSR2 is better than AMSR-E. This is achieved by selecting two year-long comparative time periods from the operating periods of AMSR-E and AMSR2, based on their statistical similarities in modeled SM as a proxy, using Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-L). The AMSR2 and AMSR-E C- and X-band SM derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was evaluated. Both AMSR2 C- and X-band SM products were found to show similar temporal patterns and spatial agreement with AMSR-E C- and X-band SM, supported by unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and R-values with MERRA-L SM, respectively. Using lag-based instrumental variable analysis to estimate the random error component of SM retrievals, the noise-to-signal ratios in AMSR2 X-band SM were found to be slightly higher than their AMSR-E counterparts. The improvements in AMSR2, such as the superior radiometric sensitivity and spatial resolution, have therefore not led to statistically significant differences in performance for LPRM retrievals at 1/2\u00b0 \u00d7 1/2\u00b0 grid resolution, when compared with AMSR-E. However, similarities in the metrics for AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM suggest that AMSR2 provides a valuable continuation to AMSR-E."

This conclusion critically relies on the untested assumption that reminders of a crime uncontrollably elicit memory-related brain activity. However, recent research indicates that, in some circumstances, humans can control whether they remember a previous experience by intentionally suppressing retrieval. We examined whether people could use retrieval suppression to conceal neural evidence of incriminating memories as indexed by Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). When people were motivated to suppress crime retrieval, their memory-related ERP effects were significantly decreased, allowing guilty individuals to evade detection. Our findings indicate that brain measures of guilty knowledge may be under criminals\u2019 intentional control and place limits on their use in legal settings."

Firstly, in boosting iterative quantization hashing embedding, we adopt boosting-based method to generate inputs to learn hashing functions. Then we optimize the hashing functions with a loss function by considering the relationship between samples. Once the hashing codes are generated, Query-Adaptive Reranking (QAR) method is proposed to learn bit-level weights for each category and query-adaptive weights for each hashing bit. In this way, the discrete Hamming distance value can be continuous, and many irrelevant returned images can be sorted to the back. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, and comparison results with six state-of-the-art methods to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Built on a comprehensive literature review and comprising input by both satellite experts and emission inventory specialists, the review identifies several targets that seem promising: large point sources of NOx and SO2, species that are difficult to measure by other means (NH3 and CH4, for example), area sources that cannot easily be quantified by traditional bottom-up methods (such as unconventional oil and gas extraction, shipping, biomass burning, and biogenic sources), and the temporal variation of emissions (seasonal, diurnal, episodic). Techniques that enhance the usefulness of current retrievals (data assimilation, oversampling, multi-species retrievals, improved vertical profiles, etc.) are discussed. Finally, we point out the value of having new geostationary satellites like GEO-CAPE and TEMPO over North America that could provide measurements at high spatial (few km) and temporal (hourly) resolution."

This paper reports the findings of a user study that explored temporal information searching behaviour and strategies in a laboratory setting. Information needs were grouped into three temporal classes (Past, Recency, and Future) to systematically study their characteristics. The main findings of our experiment are as follows. (1) It is intuitive for people to augment topical keywords with temporal expressions such as history, recent, or future as a tactic of temporal search. (2) However, such queries produce mixed results and the success of query reformulations appears to depend on topics to a large extent. (3) Search engine interfaces should detect temporal information needs to trigger the display of temporal search options. (4) Finding a relevant Wikipedia page or similar summary page is a popular starting point of past information needs. (5) Current search engines do a good job for information needs related to recent events, but more work is needed for past and future tasks. (6) Participants found it most difficult to find future information. Searching for domain experts was a key tactic in Future search, and file types of relevant documents are different from other temporal classes. Overall, the comparison of search across temporal classes indicated that Future search was the most difficult and the least successful followed by the search for the Past and then for Recency information. This paper discusses the implications of these findings on the design of future temporal IR systems."

        "abstract": "Syneruptive gas flux time series can, in principle, be retrieved from satellite maps of SO2 collected during and immediately after volcanic eruptions, and used to gain insights into the volcanic processes which drive the volcanic activity. Determination of the age and height of volcanic plumes are key prerequisites for such calculations. However, these parameters are challenging to constrain using satellite-based techniques. Here, we use imagery from OMI and GOME-2 satellite sensors and a novel numerical procedure based on back-trajectory analysis to calculate plume height as a function of position at the satellite measurement time together with plume injection height and time at a volcanic vent location. We applied this new procedure to three Etna eruptions (12 August 2011, 18 March 2012 and 12 April 2013) and compared our results with independent satellite and ground-based estimations. We also compare our injection height time-series with measurements of volcanic tremor, which reflects the eruption intensity, showing a good match between these two datasets. Our results are a milestone in progressing towards reliable determination of gas flux data from satellite-derived SO2 maps during volcanic eruptions, which would be of great value for operational management of explosive eruptions."

The objective of this paper is to verify how action and verb processing deficits of PD patients are modulated by different tasks with different cognitive demands. Action and object lexical-semantic processing was evaluated in patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and cognitively healthy controls through three different tasks (verbal fluency, naming and semantic association). Compared to controls, PD patients presented worse performance in naming actions and in the two semantic association tasks (action/object). Action verbal fluency performance was significantly associated with PD severity whereas object semantic association deficits and noun verbal fluency scores were associated to lower scores in measures of global cognitive functioning. Our data suggest that semantic deficits are related to the type of cognitive processing and this is in the line with more flexible EC accounts."

For convenience, it is called the CBIRVP method hereafter. First, the CBIRVP method extracts three kinds of features: color, texture, and shape features of images. Subsequently, it employs appropriate distance measurements for each kind of features to calculate the similarities between a query image and others in the database D. Also, the PSO algorithm is utilized to optimize the CBIRVP method via searching for nearly optimal combinations between the features and their corresponding similarity measurements, as well as finding out the approximately optimal weights for three similarities with respect to three kinds of features. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the CBIRVP method outperforms other existing methods under consideration here."

Our method combines a mesh global description and mesh partition descriptions to represent a 3D shape. The partitioning is useful because it helps us to extract additional information in a more local sense. Thus, part descriptions can mitigate the semantic gap imposed by global description methods. We propose to find spatial agglomerations of local features to generate mesh partitions. Hence, the definition of a distance function is stated as an optimization problem to find the best match between two shape representations. We show that mesh partitions are representative and therefore it helps to improve the effectiveness in retrieval tasks. We present exhaustive experimentation using the SHREC'09 Generic Shape Retrieval Benchmark."

However, when searchers are asked to describe their image needs, the resulting query is often short and potentially ambiguous. The solution we propose is to perform automatic query expansion using Wikipedia as the source knowledge base, resulting in a diversification of the search results. The outcome is a broad range of images that represent the various possible interpretations of the query. In order to assist the searcher in finding images that match their specific intentions for the query, we have developed an image organization method that uses both the conceptual information associated with each image, and the visual features extracted from the images. This, coupled with a hierarchical organization of the concepts, provides an interactive interface that takes advantage of the searchers\u2019 abilities to recognize relevant concepts, filter and focus the search results based on these concepts, and visually identify relevant images while navigating within the image space. In this paper, we outline the key features of our image retrieval system (CIDER), and present the results of a preliminary user evaluation. The results of this study illustrate the potential benefits that CIDER can provide for searchers conducting image retrieval tasks."

Previous studies demonstrated the retrieval of Fs on a global scale using high spectral resolution measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on board the greenhouse gases observing satellite (GOSAT). The retrieval of Fs from GOSAT-FTS data is based on the modeling of the in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines by Fs. The first Fs retrieval methods for GOSAT-FTS measurements were based on physical formulations of the radiative transfer between the atmosphere, the surface and the instrument including the Fs emission. As an alternative, a statistical method was also successfully applied to GOSAT data. This method is based on a singular vector decomposition (SVD) technique producing a basis of spectral functions able to model the contribution of the reflected solar radiation to the top-of-atmosphere measurement in a linear way. The Fs signal is included in the forward model as an extra parameter adding to the reflected solar radiation. Here, we use field spectroscopy measurements to provide further experimental evidence on the retrieval of Fs with statistical approaches in both Fraunhofer lines and atmospheric oxygen and water vapor bands. The statistical retrieval method used with GOSAT-FTS data has been adapted to a set of ground-based spectro-radiometer measurements in the 717\u2013780 nm range. Retrieval results in the 745\u2013759 nm window, which contains only Fraunhofer lines, support the overall approach of estimating Fs from space measurements in that spectral window. Furthermore, the application of the method to broader fitting windows including both Fraunhofer lines and and (oxygen and water vapor) atmospheric bands atmospheric bands has been proven to be very effective to reduce the retrieval noise and has also shown a good comparison with reference O2A-based retrievals. This allows consideration of statistical methods as a powerful option for Fs retrieval from broad-band space-based measurements in the near-infrared."

The harmonic parameter estimation of regenerative chatter responses is detailed, which include the harmonic frequencies, cross powers, and phase shifts between successive cuts.

        "abstract": "Relevance feedback methods in CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval) iteratively use relevance information from the user to search the space for other relevant samples. As several regions of interest may be scattered through the space, an effective search algorithm should balance the exploration of the space to find new potential regions of interest and the exploitation of areas around samples which are known relevant. However, many algorithms concentrate the search on areas which are close to the images that the user has marked as relevant, according to a distance function in the (possibly deformed) multidimensional feature space. This maximizes the number of relevant images retrieved at the first iterations, but limits the discovery of new regions of interest and may leave unexplored a large section of the space. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach that uses a scattered search algorithm based on NSGA II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) only at the first iteration of the relevance feedback process, and then switches to an exploitation algorithm. The combined approach has been tested on three databases and in combination with several other methods. When the hybrid method does not produce better results from the first iteration, it soon catches up and improves both precision and recall."

Dose-dependent effects and differences between genomic and non-genomic cortisol effects are possible reasons for these discrepancies. The aim of the current experiment was to assess the non-genomic effects of escalating doses of intravenous cortisol on cued recall of socially relevant information in humans. 40 participants (age range 20\u201330 years; 20 females) learned associations between male faces with a neutral facial expression and descriptions of either positive or negative social behaviors and were tested one week later in a cued recall paradigm. Escalating doses of cortisol (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 mg) were administered 8 min before testing according to a between-subjects design. An inverted U-shaped dose\u2013response relationship between salivary cortisol levels and recall performance was observed, with moderate elevation of salivary cortisol resulting in the best recall performance. This is the first study in humans demonstrating that cortisol rapidly modulates declarative memory retrieval via a dose-dependent, non-genomic mechanism that follows an inverted U-shaped curve. Our result further emphasizes the importance of fast cortisol effects for human cognition."

Two physical pretreatments were performed at pilot scale in order to recover electrodic powders: the first including crushing, milling, and sieving and the second granulation, and sieving. Recovery yield of electrodic powder was significantly influenced by the type of pretreatment. About 50% of initial LIB wastes was recovered by the first treatment (as electrodic powder with size &lt;0.5 mm, Sample 1), while only 37% of powder with size &lt;1 mm (Sample 2) can be recovered by the second treatment. Chemical digestion put in evidence the heterogeneity of recovered powders denoting different amounts of Co, Mn, and Ni. Leaching tests of both powders were performed in order to determine optimized conditions for metal extraction. Solid/liquid ratios and sulfuric acid concentrations were changed according to factorial designs at constant temperature (80 \u00b0C). Optimized conditions for quantitative extraction (&gt;99%) of Co and Li from Sample 1 are 1/10 g/mL as solid/liquid ratio and +50% stoichiometric excess of acid (1.1 M). Using the same solid/liquid ratio, +100% acid excess (1.2 M) is necessary to extract 96% of Co and 86% of Li from Sample 2. Best conditions for leaching of Sample 2 using glucose are +200% acid excess (1.7 M) and 0.05 M glucose concentration. Optimized conditions found in this work are among the most effective reported in the literature in term of Co extraction and reagent consumption."

Here we seek to determine the lower-mantle anelasticity through the solution of the complex Love numbers at the Chandler wobble period.

They further lead to estimates of the corresponding mantle anelastic parameters f r and f i , which in turn determines, under the single-absorption band assumption, the dispersion exponent of \u03b1 = 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 with respect to the reference frequency of 5 mHz. We believe our estimate is robust and hence can better constrain the mantle anelasticity and attenuation models of the Earth interior."

The mathematical model is able to solve small-size cases to optimality in reasonable computational times. Unfortunately, it requires large computational times when tackling medium and large-size scenarios. For its part, the heuristic algorithm overcomes the problems associated with the computational burden of the model by bringing forward the availability of blocks to retrieve from the storage. With this goal in mind, several look ahead strategies dedicated to perform the most promising predictive block relocation movements are proposed.

The model has a dynamic structure based on relevance feedback and interactions with users. Furthermore, this work introduces a multi-ontology query expansion model which uses user-oriented ontologies, UPSs and semantic feature-selection algorithms to expand queries. In this model, knowledge-spanning trees are generated from ontology/UPS graphs based on the queries. These knowledge-spanning trees contain semantic features which enhance the representations of the original queries and further facilitate personalised retrieval on a semantic basis.
